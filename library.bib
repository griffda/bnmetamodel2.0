   abstract = {Extensive studies of fusion economics have been performed in the last decade within the European Union and the United States. Over the same period major advances have been made in the physics and technology of fusion. This paper summarizes the prospects for fusion making an economically attractive contribution to the future energy mix. With modest physics optimization and anticipated near-term materials, the internal costs of fusion electricity would be about 50% more expensive than electricity from fossil fuels (not counting the costs of pollution abatement) and roughly comparable to renewables. Unlike renewables, fusion provides firm power. The use of advanced materials, technology and physics leads to an internal cost of fusion electricity approaching the internal cost from fission or fossil. Fusion has small external costs, along with wind, about an order of magnitude lower than fossil. Energy scenarios show that fusion could contribute significantly to large-scale electricity production during the second half of the century; the overall cost of fusion electricity is likely to be comparable with that from other environmentally responsible sources of electricity generation.},

Apart from the environmental and energy security benefits, fusion energy deployment would stimulate economic growth and employment. This research provides novel results of the global socioeconomic (value added, employment) and environmental (CO2) effects of the investments in a fusion power plant of 1.45 GW hypothetically deployed in Europe. A multi-regional input-output approach is used. Results show a multiplier effect in the production of goods and services of 2.2 (3.6 considering induced effects). The most benefited are Europe (47%) and United States (20%), due to the investment phase. In O&M, China and Japan arise as important suppliers. Most of value added would be captured in Europe (48%) and the United States (28%), being mining, construction and business services the most benefited activities. Intensive in employment generation, it would create 183 thousand full-time equivalent jobs, mainly in Europe (46%) and China (21%). The carbon footprint would be 11.4 gCO2/kWh mostly originated in Europe, United States and Japan, with a similar share. When considered, induced effects have a relevant impact on results.

   abstract = {The events of March 2011 at the nuclear power complex in Fukushima, Japan, raised questions about the safe operation of nuclear power plants, with early retirement of existing nuclear power plants being debated in the policy arena and considered by regulators. Also, the future of building new nuclear power plants is highly uncertain. Should nuclear power policies become more restrictive, one potential option for climate change mitigation will be less available. However, a systematic analysis of nuclear power policies, including early retirement, has been missing in the climate change mitigation literature. We apply an energy economy model framework to derive scenarios and analyze the interactions and tradeoffs between these two policy fields. Our results indicate that early retirement of nuclear power plants leads to discounted cumulative global GDP losses of 0.07% by 2020. If, in addition, new nuclear investments are excluded, total losses will double. The effect of climate policies imposed by an intertemporal carbon budget on incremental costs of policies restricting nuclear power use is small. However, climate policies have much larger impacts than policies restricting the use of nuclear power. The carbon budget leads to cumulative discounted near term reductions of global GDP of 0.64% until 2020. Intertemporal flexibility of the carbon budget approach enables higher near-term emissions as a result of increased power generation from natural gas to fill the emerging gap in electricity supply, while still remaining within the overall carbon budget. Demand reductions and efficiency improvements are the second major response strategy.},

Advanced next-generation higher performance steels offer the opportunity for improvements in fusion reactor operational lifetime and reliability, superior neutron radiation damage resistance, higher thermodynamic efficiency, and reduced construction costs. The two main strategies for developing improved steels for fusion energy applications are based on 1) an evolutionary pathway using computational thermodynamics modelling and modified thermomechanical treatments (TMT) to produce higher performance reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steels and 2) a higher risk, potentially higher payoff approach based on powder metallurgy techniques to produce very high strength oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) steels capable of operation to very high temperatures and with potentially very high resistance to fusion neutron-induced property degradation. The current development status of these next-generation high performance steels is summarized, and research and development challenges for the successful development of these materials are outlined. Material properties including temperature-dependent uniaxial yield strengths, tensile elongations, high-temperature thermal creep, Charpy impact ductile to brittle transient temperature (DBTT) and fracture toughness behaviour, and neutron irradiation-induced low-temperature hardening and embrittlement and intermediate-temperature volumetric void swelling (including effects associated with fusion-relevant helium and hydrogen generation) are described for research heats of the new steels.},

The limit sales price of electricity was found using the net present value method. The levelized cost of electricity LCOE method with the inclusion of external costs is used for a comparison of selected power plant types based on the OECD statistical data and the EU ExternE project results. The comparison shows the levelized cost of electricity of fusion power plants competitive to the actual renewable resources.

ETM is an optimization global energy model which aims at providing the optimum energy system composition in terms of social wealth and sustainability including fusion as an alternative technology in the long term. Two framework scenarios are defined: a Base case scenario with no limits to CO 2 emissions, and a 450ppm scenario with a limit of 450ppm in CO 2-eq concentrations set by 2100. Previous results showed that in the Base case scenario, with no measures for CO 2 emission reductions, fusion does not enter the energy system. However, when CO 2 emission restrictions are imposed, the global energy system composition changes completely. In a 450ppm scenario, coal technologies disappear in a few decades, being mainly replaced by nuclear fission technologies which experience a great increase when constrained only by Uranium resources exhaustion. Fission technologies are then replaced by the fusion power plants that start in 2070, with a significant contribution to the global electricity production by 2100. To conclude the work, a sensitivity analysis will be presented on some parameters that may affect the possible role of fusion in the future global energy system.},

   abstract = {The speed at which fusion energy can be deployed is considered. Several economical factors are identified that impede this speed. Most importantly, the combination of an unprecedentedly high investment level needed for the proof of principle and the relatively long construction time of fusion plants precludes an effective innovation cycle. The valley of death is discussed, i.e. the period when a large investment is needed for the construction of early generations of fusion reactors, when there is no return yet. It is concluded that, within the mainstream scenario-a few DEMO reactors towards 2060 followed by generations of relatively large reactors-there is no realistic path to an appreciable contribution to the energy mix in the twenty-first century if economic constraints are applied. In other words, fusion will not contribute to the energy transition in the time frame of the Paris climate agreement. Within the frame of this analysis, the development of smaller, cheaper and most importantly, fast-to-build fusion plants could possibly represent an option to accelerate the introduction of fusion power. Whether this is possible is a technical question that is outside the scope of this paper, but this question is addressed in other contributions to the Royal Society workshop. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Fusion energy using tokamaks: can development be accelerated?'.},

   abstract = {The road map of fusion power is compared to the development and deployment of other energy technologies. A generic deployment model is presented, which describes the fastest deployment (of any new technology) achievable with the constraint that the industrial capacity that needs to be built up must be continuous and should not overshoot the replacement market in the final, saturated state. It is shown that the development needs an ‘investment’ phase to build up industrial capacity which takes several decades, during which growth is typically exponential, but net energy production is negligible. During the exponential growth the cost is dominated by the capital investment, which allows for a simple comparison of different energy technologies. Fusion is at the start of the exponential growth phase, while still having significant uncertainties concerning its technical feasibility. In comparison to e.g. solar PV and wind, fusion is ‘late’, lagging by some 50 years. To follow the same rate of development that fission, wind and PV have shown, fusion will need to have 3 DEMO reactors operational in the early 2050s, followed by 10 generation one (GEN1) plants in the early 2060s and 100 GEN2 plants in the early 2070s. For the cost development to be comparable, an estimated allowable cost for one DEMO reactor is ~20 G$. While these indicative numbers for the pace and cost of development are very challenging but perhaps not unthinkable for fusion, this analysis does point towards an emphasis on ‘simpler and cheaper’ reactor designs.},

In the compact spherical tokamak, shielding efficiency improvements are particularly needed because of severe space constraints. The most spatially restricted component is the central column. This shield must protect superconducting magnets from excessive radiation-induced degradation, but also from associated heating, so that energy consumption of the cryogenic systems is kept to an acceptable level. Recent simulations show that tungsten carbide and its composites form an attractive class of neutron-attenuating materials. In this paper, the key structure-property relationships of these materials are assessed, as they relate to generic materials challenges for plasma-facing materials. We first consider some of fundamental materials properties of monolithic tungsten carbide including thermal transport, mechanical properties and plasma interaction. WC is found to have generally favourable properties compared to metallic tungsten shields. We then report progress on the development of a new candidate cermet material, WC-FeCr. Recent results on its accident safety, thermo-mechanical properties, and irradiation behaviour are presented. This review also highlights the need for further study, particularly in the areas of irradiation damage and hydrogen trapping.},

In this paper, we present an alternative route, based on the modular approach, when the economically feasible fusion power plant will consist of several modules, where the physics and technology are developed for a single compact module, making the development path cheaper and quicker. The economics is based on that for a modular-based plant, where many auxiliaries are shared between modules, and a regular necessary maintenance is set in a module-to-module way, providing high availability of the power plant. An expression for the cost of the generation of electricity (CoE) and identification of cost factors important for the modular approach are presented. The minimal size of a single module is determined by the physics and technologies developed up to date. The presented cost example for a modular power plant is based on the selected set of parameters for a single module and the necessary number of the modules in an economically feasible power plant. The cost of electricity (CoE), dependence of the CoE on the neutron wall loading and the effect of a module reservation are examined in detail. While the final cost of the new approach may be not significantly cheaper than for the mainstream approach, the development path has many advantages and can be affordable and much faster, supported by the combination of private and public funding.},

However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking’ were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang.

Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors).

The majority of development thus far has been via publicly-funded programmes led by government laboratories focused on scientific research and in which commercialisation strategy and innovation play a minor role. Generally, such programmes follow a linear model of innovation in which commercial aspects are not considered until later in development. In consequence and without intention, devices not well-suited for commercial application are being pursued. In recent years, however, privately funded fusion start-ups have emerged with the goal of accelerating the commercialisation of fusion. Fusion start-ups are, by necessity, operating on a fundamentally different model of innovation: agile innovation, whereby technology is developed flexibly and iteratively towards an explicit commercial goal. Technology Roadmapping is a method that has been effective for supporting agile innovation but thus far has had limited application to mission-led hardware development. We characterise the key features of the fusion innovation approach and create a novel Technology Roadmapping process for fusion start-ups, which is developed via a case study with Tokamak Energy Ltd.

The alternative technologies include coal burning, coal gasification, natural gas, nuclear fission, and renewable energy. The cost of electricity (COE) from the alternatives to fusion should be in a 30 to 53 mills/ kW·h (1999 dollars) range if carbon sequestration is not needed, 30 to 61 mills/kW·h if sequestration is required, or as high as 83 mills/kW·h for the worst-case scenario for cost uncertainty. The reference COE range for fusion was estimated at 65 to 102 mills/kW·h for 1- to 1.3-GW(electric) scale power plants, based on the tokamak concept. Tokamak fusion costs will have to be reduced and/or cost-effective alternative nontokamak concepts devised before fusion will be competitive with the alternatives for the future production of electricity. Fortunately, there are routes to achieve this goal. Recent results from fusion experiments and developments in technology and engineering solutions indicate that lower cost fusion power plants are possible at the 1-GW(electric) level. Another general route for fusion to reduce costs is to go to large plant sizes [multigigawatts (electric)].},

Therefore, in order to model how such plants may operate and what their output might be, extrapolations must be made from existing experimental data and technology. However, the expected performance of a plant built to the operating point specifications can only ever be a 'best guess'. Extrapolations far beyond the current operating regimes are necessarily uncertain, and some important interactions, for example the coupling of conducted power from the scape-off layer to the divertor surface, lack reliable predictive models. This means both that the demands on plant systems at the target operating point can vary significantly from the nominal value, and that the overall plant performance may potentially fall short of design targets. In this contribution we discuss tools and techniques that have been developed to assess the robustness of the operating points for the EU-DEMO tokamak-based demonstration power plant, and the consequences for its design. The aim is to make explicit the design choices and areas where improved modelling and DEMO-relevant experiments will have the greatest impact on confidence in a successful DEMO design.},

How the global energy system will be as for that time nobody knows, but future can be explored by means of scenarios. In this work, several scenarios have been formulated and represented by the EFDA Times model (ETM), a global optimization energy model developed within the framework of the Socio Economic Research of Fusion project (SERF) in EFDA. Some analyses on the evolution of the global energy system in the long term under different scenarios have been carried out with especial focus on the future role of fusion technologies. Different issues related to fusion development have been analysed for each scenario using the ETM model. Results show that fusion technologies participation in the global electricity system by 2100 goes from 10% to 14% depending on the storyline. Using Paternalism as a Reference scenario, some additional analyses have been done. Preliminary results show that the global rate of fusion technologies growth is 12% per year from 2070 to 2100. Besides, fusion penetration is very sensitive to investment cost variations going from 13% to 42% when investment costs are 30% lower than in the Reference case and from 13% to 1% when those costs are 30% higher. Regarding the hypothetical case of fusion technologies anticipation, at the beginning, the penetration is low and similar in both scenarios, Reference and Anticipation, but at the end of the period it is much higher in Anticipation, mainly due to the advanced reactors penetration. Finally, sensitivity analyses have been performed on key parameters such as the discount rate of each technology. The results show that the lower the discount rate, the higher the share of fusion in the global electricity system.},

   abstract = {The aim of this study is to assess the potential impact of the transportation sector on the role of fusion power in the energy system of the 21st century. Key indicators in this context are global passenger and freight transportation activities, consumption levels of fuels used for transportation purposes, the electricity generation mix and greenhouse gas emissions. These quantities are calculated by means of the global multi-regional EFDA-TIMES energy system model. For the present study a new transportation module has been linked to the EFDA-TIMES framework in order to arrive at a consistent projection of future transportation demands. Results are discussed implying various global energy scenarios including assumed crossovers of road transportation activities towards hydrogen or electricity infrastructures and atmospheric CO2 concentration stabilization levels at 550 ppm and 450 ppm. Our results show that the penetration of fusion power plants is only slightly sensitive to transportation fuel choices but depends strongly on assumed climate policies. In the most stringent case considered here the contribution of electricity produced by fusion power plants can become as large as about 50% at the end of the 21st century. This statement, however, is still of preliminary nature as the EFDA-TIMES project has not yet reached a final status. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The European Roadmap towards the production of electricity from nuclear fusion foresees the potential availability of nuclear fusion power plants (NFPPs) in the second half of this century. The possible penetration of that technology, typically addressed by using the global energy system EUROFusion TIMES Model (ETM), will depend, among other aspects, on its costs compared to those of the other available technologies for electricity production, and on the future electricity demand. This paper focuses on the ongoing electrification process of the transport sector, with special attention devoted to road transport. A survey on the present and forthcoming technologies, as foreseen by several manufacturers and other models, and an international vehicle database are taken into account to develop the new road transport module, then implemented and harmonized inside ETM. Following three different storylines, the computed results are presented in terms of the evolution of the road transport demand in the next decades, fleet composition and CO2emissions. The ETM results are in line with many other studies. On one hand, they highlight, for the European road transport energy consumption pattern, the need for dramatic changes in the transport market, if the most ambitious environmental goals are to be pursued. On the other hand, the results also show that NFPP adoption on a commercial scale could be justified within the current projection of the investment costs, if the deep penetration of electricity in the road transport sector also occurs.},

   abstract = {Within the European power plant conceptual study (PPCS) four fusion power plant "models", all based on the tokamak concept, have been developed. Two of these models, A and B, were developed considering limited extrapolations both in physics and in technology. PPCS model A is based on the WCLL blanket [M. Gasparotto et al., DEMO blanket technology R&D results in the EU, Fusion Eng. Des. 61-62 (2002) 263-271] and on a water-cooled divertor concept. PPCS model B is based on the HCPB blanket [M. Gasparotto et al., DEMO blanket technology R&D results in the EU, Fusion Eng. Des. 61-62 (2002) 263-271] and on a helium-cooled divertor concept. For each of the more advanced concepts, models C and D, an advanced physics scenario has been identified and combined with advanced blanket concepts that allow higher thermodynamic efficiencies of the power conversion systems. Two key innovative developments are worthy of especial note: the development of a scheme for the scheduled replacement of the internal components and the conceptual design for a helium-cooled divertor. For all models, systems analyses were used to integrate the plasma physics and technology constraints to produce self-consistent plant parameter sets with approximately optimal economic characteristics. In the PPCS models, the favourable, inherent, features of fusion have been exploited to provide substantial safety and environmental advantages. The broad features of the conclusions of previous studies have been confirmed for the new models. Finally, the PPCS study has highlighted the need for specific design and R&D activities in addition to those already underway within the European long term R&D programme. © 2005 The European Commission 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {On the path to Fusion power, the construction of ITER is ongoing , however there is not much progress in performance improvements of tokamaks in the last 15 years, Fig.1. One possible reason for this stagnation is the lack of innovations in physics and technology that could be implemented with this approach in which progress is expected mainly from the increase in the size of a Fusion device. Such innovations could be easier to test and use in much smaller (and so cheaper and quicker to build) compact Fusion devices. In this paper we propose a new path to Fusion energy based on a compact high field Spherical Tokamak approach.},

   abstract = {Although fusion power is being developed because of its large resource base, low environmental impact and high levels of intrinsic safety, it is important to investigate the economics of a future fusion power plant to check that the electricity produced can, in fact, have a market. The direct cost of electricity of a fusion power plant and its key dependencies on the physics and technology assumptions, are calculated, as are the materials requirements. The other important aspect of costs, the external costs which can arise from effects such as pollution, accidents and waste are also given. Fusion is found to offer the prospect of a new energy source with acceptable direct costs and very low external costs. This places fusion in a strong position in a future energy market, especially one in which environmental constraints become increasingly important. 1. Cost of electricity methodology The following results are derived using a systems code, PROCESS [1], to produce consistent models of conceptual power plants and, using costing algorithms validated against existing machines as well as ITER costs, to determine the capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, fuel costs, cost of replaceable components and decommissioning costs. These are used to determine the levelised cost of electricity [2]: coe = t (C t + OM t + F t + R t + D t)(1 + r) −t t E t (1 + r) −t (1) * Corresponding author. (D.J. Ward). where the capital, C, operation and maintenance, OM, fuel, F, replaceable components, R, and decommis-sioning costs, D, as well as the income stream from electricity sales, are discounted back to the start of operation with a discount rate r. The cost of electricity, coe, is determined by equating the total discounted costs to the total discounted income stream. 2. Economics of a conservative plant In this introductory section, we consider the economic viability of a fusion power plant based around the parameters of the ITER design [3], developed into a power plant. In particular, a value of normalised β (β N) of 1.7 and moderate values of H-factor, density 0920-3796/$-see front matter},

   abstract = {Plasma wall interaction (PWI) is important for the material choice in ITER and for the plasma scenarios compatible with material constraints. In this paper, different aspects of the PWI are assessed in their importance for the initial wall materials choice: CFC for the strike point tiles, W in the divertor and baffle and Be on the first wall. Further material options are addressed for comparison, such as W divertor/Be first wall and all-W or all-C. One main parameter in this evaluation is the particle flux to the main vessel wall. One detailed plasma scenario exists for a Q = 10 ITER discharge [G. Federici et al., J. Nucl. Mater. 290-293 (2001) 260] which was taken as the basis of further erosion and tritium retention evaluations. As the assessment of steady state wall fluxes from a scaling of present fusion devices indicates that global wall fluxes may be a factor of 4 ± 3 higher, this margin has been adopted as uncertainty of the scaling. With these wall and divertor fluxes, important PWI processes such as erosion and tritium accumulation have been evaluated: It was found that the steady state erosion is no problem for the lifetime of plasma-facing divertor components. Be wall erosion may pose a problem in case of a concentration of the wall fluxes to small wall areas. ELM erosion may drastically limit the PFC lifetime if ELMs are not mitigated to energies below 0.5 MJ. Dust generation is still a process which requires more attention. Conversion from gross or net erosion to dust and the assessment of dust on hot surfaces need to be investigated. For low-Z materials the build-up of the tritium inventory is dominated by co-deposition with eroded wall atoms. For W, where erosion and tritium co-deposition are small, the implantation, diffusion and bulk trapping constitute the dominant retention processes. First extrapolations with models based on laboratory data show small contributions to the inventory. For later ITER phases and the extrapolation to DEMO additional tritium trapping sites due to neutron-irradiation damage need to be taken into account. Finally, the expected values for erosion and tritium retention are compared to the ITER administrative limits for the lifetime, dust and tritium inventory. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

The most important features of the H-mode are a minimum threshold edge temperature (threshold input power) required to achieve the H-mode; the bifurcation nature of the H-transition with instantaneous changes at the plasma edge; and the formation of a transport barrier at the plasma edge leading to pedestals in the density and temperature profiles. Global energy confinement times, are typically 2× to 3× longer in H- than in L-mode plasmas, reaching, for example, almost 1s in 3MA JET X-point discharges. τE is found to increase linearly with plasma current. Results of the variation of τE with input power are somewhat contradictory: no power dependence is found in ASDEX and DIII-D, whereas a degradation with power is indicated in JET and in JFT-2M limiter H-modes. Correspondingly, predictions for full power (40MW) 6MA X-point discharges in JET range from 0.6s to >1s, depending upon which scaling is adopted. Two main theoretical models have been proposed to explain the H-mode with its heat barrier at the plasma edge. Such a barrier is predicted by the stability properties of ballooning modes close to a magnetic separatrix, corresponding to the transition to a second stable region above a certain threshold power. It could also arise from a critical temperature gradient model based on self-consistent stochasticity.},

   abstract = {The H-mode is a confinement mode of toroidal plasmas, which may make the goals of fusion possible - the development of a clean energy source at competitive electricity costs. The most challenging aspect of the H-mode physics is the sudden disappearance of the edge turbulence whereas its driving forces - the gradients - increase. As the physics behind the H-mode is subtle many features are not yet clarified. There is, however, substantial experimental and theoretical evidence that turbulent flows, which normally limit the confinement, are diminished by sheared poloidal flow residing at the plasma edge. There are many conceivable mechanisms giving rise to sheared flow. The most intriguing of these is that fluctuations themselves induce the flow, which acts back to its generating origin and annihilates the turbulence. This review concentrates mostly on the transition physics, describes one line of understanding the H-mode in more detail, recalls some of the older observations and summarizes the achievements in the H-mode for both tokamaks and stellarators. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Performance in H-mode DT plasmas in ITER with various choices of heating systems are predicted and compared. Combinations of external heating by negative ion neutral beam injection (NNBI), ion cyclotron range of frequencies and electron cyclotron heating are assumed. Scans with a range of physics assumptions about boundary temperatures in the edge pedestal, alpha ash transport and toroidal momentum transport are used to indicate effects of uncertainties. Time-dependent integrated modelling with the PTRANSP code is used to predict profiles of heating, beam torque and plasma profiles. The GLF23 model is used to predict temperature profiles. Either GLF23 or the assumption of a constant ratio for χφ/χi is used to predict toroidal rotation profiles driven by the beam torques. Large differences for the core temperatures are predicted with different mixes of the external heating during the density and current ramp-up phase, but the profiles are similar during the flat-top phase. With χφ/χi = 0.5, the predicted toroidal rotation is relatively slow and the flow shear implied by the pressure, toroidal rotation and neoclassical poloidal rotation are not sufficient to cause significant changes in the energy transport or steady state temperature profiles. The GLF23-predicted toroidal rotation is faster by a factor of six, and significant flow shear effects are predicted. Heating mixes with more NNBI power are predicted to have up to 20% higher fusion power during steady state phases. This advantage is decisive in some cases where the physics assumptions are close to marginal or critical values. L-mode plasmas are predicted having QDT ≃ 2-4. © 2009 IAEA, Vienna.},

   abstract = {The tungsten (W) material in the high heat flux regions of the ITER divertor will be exposed to high fluxes of low-energy particles (e.g. H, D, T, He, Ne and/or N). Combined with long-pulse operations, this implies fluences well in excess of the highest values reached in today's tokamak experiments. Shaping of the individual monoblock top surface and tilting of the vertical targets for leading-edge protection lead to an increased surface heat flux, and thus increased surface temperature and a reduced margin to remain below the temperature at which recrystallization and grain growth begin. Significant morphology changes are known to occur on W after exposure to high fluences of low-energy particles, be it H or He. An analysis of the formation conditions of these morphology changes is made in relation to the conditions expected at the vertical targets during different phases of operations. It is concluded that both H and He-related effects can occur in ITER. In particular, the case of He-induced nanostructure (also known as 'fuzz') is reviewed. Fuzz formation appears possible over a limited region of the outer vertical target, the inner target being generally a net Be deposition area. A simple analysis of the fuzz growth rate including the effect of edge-localized modes (ELMs) and the reduced thermal conductivity of fuzz shows that the fuzz thickness is likely to be limited by the occurrence of annealing during ELM-induced thermal excursions. Not only the morphology, but the material mechanical and thermal properties can be modified by plasma exposure. A review of the existing literature is made, but the existing data are insufficient to conclude quantitatively on the importance and extent of these effects for ITER. As a consequence of the high surface temperatures in ITER, W recrystallization is an important effect to consider, since it leads to a decrease in material strength. An approach is proposed here to develop an operational budget for the W material, i.e. the time the divertor material can be operated at a given temperature before a significant fraction of the material is recrystallized. In general, while it is clear that significant surface damage can occur during ITER operations, the tolerable level of damage in terms of plasma operations currently remains unknown.},

   abstract = {In the next 50 yr, the world will need to develop hundreds of gigawatts of non-fossil-fuel energy sources for production of electricity and fuels. Nuclear fusion can probably provide much of the required energy economically, if large single-unit power plants are acceptable. Large power plants are more common than most people realize: There are already many multiple-unit power plants producing 2 to 5 GW (electric) at a single site. The cost of electricity (COE) from fusion energy is predicted to scale as COE ≈ COE0(P/P0)-n, where P is the electrical power, the subscript zero denotes reference values, and the exponent n ≈ 0.36 to 0.7 in various designs. The validity ranges of these scalings are limited and need to be extended by future work. The fusion power economy of scale derives from four inter-related effects: improved operations and maintenance costs; scaling of equipment unit costs; a geometric effect that increases the mass power density; and reduction of the recirculating power fraction. Increased plasma size also relaxes the required confinement parameters: For the same neutron wall loading, larger tokamaks can use lower magnetic fields. Fossil-fuel power plants have a weaker economy of scale than fusion because the fuel costs constitute much of their COE. Solar and wind power plants consist of many small units, so they have little economy of scale. Fission power plants have a strong economy of scale but are unable to exploit it because the maximum unit size is limited by safety concerns. Large, steady-state fusion reactors generating 3 to 6 GW (electric) may be able to produce electricity for 4 to 5 cent/kW.h, which would be competitive with other future energy sources.},

This study examines the effects on electrical utility system hardware, operations, and reliability of incorporating such large generating units. In addition, the study evaluates the use of the coproduction of hydrogen to reduce the grid-supplied electricity and offer the possibility for electrical load-following. The estimated additional cost of electricity (COE) for a large power plant is ∼5 mills/kW·h. The estimated total COE for 3- to 4-GW(electric) fusion power plants lies in the range of 37 to 60 mills/kW·h. Future hydrogen costs from a variety of sources are estimated to lie in the range of 8 to 10 $/GJ, when allowance is made for some increase in natural gas price and for the possible need for greenhouse gas emission limitations. A number of co mbinations of fusion plant and electrolyzer were considered, including hot electrolyzers that use heat from the fusion plant. For the optimum cases, hydrogen produced from off-peak power from a 3- to 4-GW(electric) plant is estimated to have a competitive cost. Of particular interest, the cost would also be competitive if some hydrogen were produced during on-peak electricity cost periods. Thus, for a 4-GW(electric) plant, only up to 3 GW(electric) might be supplied to the grid, and load-following would be possible, which would be a benefit to the utility system.},

   abstract = {In response to social demand, this paper investigates the breakeven price (BP) and potential electricity supply of nuclear fusion energy in the 21 st century by means of a world energy and environment model. We set the following objectives in this paper: (i) to reveal the economics of the introduction conditions of nuclear fusion; (ii) to know when tokamak-type nuclear fusion reactors are expected to be introduced cost-effectively into future energy systems; (iii) to estimate the share in 2100 of electricity produced by the presently designed reactors that could be economically selected in the year. The model can give in detail the energy and environment technologies and price-induced energy saving, and can illustrate optimal energy supply structures by minimizing the costs of total discounted energy systems at a discount rate of 5%. The following parameters of nuclear fusion were considered: cost of electricity (COE) in the nuclear fusion introduction year, annual COE reduction rates, regional introduction year, and regional nuclear fusion capacity projection. The investigations are carried out for three nuclear fusion projections one of which includes tritium breeding constraints, four future CO2 concentration constraints, and technological assumptions on fossil fuels, nuclear fission, CO2 sequestration, and anonymous innovative technologies. It is concluded that: (1) the BPs are from 65 to 125 mill kW-1 h-1 depending on the introduction year of nuclear fusion under the 550 ppmv CO2 concentration constraints; those of a business-as-usual (BAU) case are from 51 to 68 mill kW-1h-1. Uncertainties resulting from the CO2 concentration constraints and the technological options influenced the BPs by plus/minus some 10-30 mill kW-1h-1, (2) tokamak-type nuclear fusion reactors (as presently designed, with a COE range around 70-130 mill kW-1 h-1) would be favourably introduced into energy systems after 2060 based on the economic criteria under the 450 and 550 ppmv CO2 concentration constraint, but not selected under the BAU case and 650 ppmv CO2 concentration constraint, and (3) the share of electricity in 2100 produced by the presently designed tokamak-type nuclear fusion reactors (introduced after 2060) is well below 30%. It should be noted that these conclusions are based upon varieties of uncertainties in scenarios and data assumptions on nuclear fusion as well as technological options.},

   abstract = {Debates about whether or not to invest heavily in nuclear fusion as a future innovative energy option have been made within the context of energy technology development strategies. This is because the prospects for nuclear fusion are quite uncertain and the investments therefore carry the risk of quite large regrets, even though investment is needed in order to develop the technology. The timeframe by which nuclear fusion could become competitive in the energy market has not been adequately studied, nor has roles of the nuclear fusion in energy systems and the environment. The present study has two objectives. One is to reveal the conditions under which nuclear fusion could be introduced economically (hereafter, we refer to such introductory conditions as breakeven prices) in future energy systems. The other objective is to evaluate the future roles of nuclear fusion in energy systems and in the environment. Here we identify three roles that nuclear fusion will take on when breakeven prices are achieved: (i) a portion of the electricity market in 2100, (ii) reduction of annual global total energy systems cost, and (iii) mitigation of carbon tax (shadow price of carbon) under CO2 constraints. Future uncertainties are key issues in evaluating nuclear fusion. Here we treated the following uncertainties: energy demand scenarios, introduction timeframe for nuclear fusion, capacity projections of nuclear fusion, CO2 target in 2100, capacity utilization ratio of options in energy/environment technologies, and utility discount rates. From our investigations, we conclude that the presently designed nuclear fusion reactors may be ready for economical introduction into energy systems beginning around 2050-2060, and we can confirm that the favorable introduction of the reactors would reduce both the annual energy systems cost and the carbon tax (the shadow price of carbon) under a CO2 concentration constraint. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {This paper aims to explore the potential role of fusion power in future electricity supply mixes and to quantify its advantages and possible drawbacks. A general assessment of the electricity system in Western Europe is performed at its current and anticipated state, estimating generic technical and economical parameters of existing and prospective power generation technologies, and building on this basis consistent electricity markets scenarios for the time horizon 2100. Various scenarios are examined, including "reference" (without fusion) and several explorative scenarios presuming different market shares of fusion, nuclear fission and coal with CO 2 capture & sequestration. The methodology applied in this study makes use of least cost electricity systems planning model PLANELEC-Pro developed by LASEN-EPFL. It is found that deployment of total 90 GWe of fusion power in Western Europe is capable to reduce up to 10 % of the total electricity system CO 2 emissions, while causing a slight increase of the levelised electricity production cost (≈ 2-3 € / MWh). Meanwhile, nuclear fission and coal with CO 2 capture & sequestration may bring about a comparable CO 2 emission reduction, though at lower cost. It is concluded that an additional socioeconomic assessment of spillover benefits of fusion technology RD&D and deployment is needed for a comprehensive analysis of the potential role of fusion power generation in future energy systems, economy and society.},

   abstract = {Although fusion power is being developed because of its large resource base, low environmental impact and high levels of intrinsic safety, it is also important to investigate the economics of a future fusion power plant in order to assess the potential market for the electricity produced. As part of the PPCS (Power Plant Conceptual Study) in Europe, published in 2005, an assessment was made of the likely economic performance of the range of fusion power plant concepts studied. Since that time, new work has been carried out, within the fusion programme, and particularly in the EU DEMO study, that changes a number of the important assumptions made in the PPCS. These changes allow either reduced cost versions of the PPCS plant models or, alternatively, plants with less ambitious technical assumptions at constant cost. The impact of the new results, emerging from the EU DEMO studies, on the role of fusion in the future energy market is described. A new energy economics model is employed to analyse the potential market performance of fusion power in a range of future energy scenarios and this shows that there can be a significant role for fusion in a future energy market. © 2009.},

   abstract = {ITER is the first fusion machine fully designed for operation with equimolar deuterium-tritium mixtures. The tokamak vessel will be fuelled through gas puffing and pellet injection, and the Neutral Beam heating system will introduce deuterium into the machine. Employing deuterium and tritium as fusion fuel will cause alpha heating of the plasma and will eventually provide energy. Due to the small burn-up fraction in the vacuum vessel a closed deuterium-tritium loop is required, along with all the auxiliary systems necessary for the safe handling of tritium. The ITER inner fuel cycle systems are designed to process considerable and unprecedented deuterium-tritium flow rates with high flexibility and reliability. High decontamination factors for effluent and release streams and low tritium inventories in all systems are needed to minimize chronic and accidental emissions. A multiple barrier concept assures the confinement of tritium within its respective processing components; atmosphere and vent detritiation systems are essential elements in this concept. Not only the interfaces between the primary fuel cycle systems - being procured through different Participant Teams - but also those to confinement systems such as Atmosphere Detritiation or those to fuelling and pumping - again procured through different Participant Teams - and interfaces to buildings are calling for definition and for detailed analysis to assure proper design integration. Considering the complexity of the ITER Tritium Plant configuration management and interface control will be a challenging task. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {It has long been recognised that the shortage of external tritium sources for fusion reactors using D-T, the most promising fusion fuel, requires all such fusion power plants (FPP) to breed their own tritium. It is also recognised that the initial start-up of a fusion reactor will require several kilograms of tritium within a scenario in which radioactive decay, ITER and subsequent demonstrator reactors are expected to have consumed most of the known tritium stockpile. To circumvent this tritium fuel shortage and ultimately achieve steady-state operation for a FPP, it is essential to first accumulate sufficient tritium to compensate for loss due to decay and significant retention in the materials in order to start a new FPP. In this work, we propose to accumulate tritium starting from D-D fusion reactions, since D exists naturally in water, and to gradually build up the D-T plasma targeted in fusion reactor designs. There are two likely D-D fusion reaction channels, (1) D + D → T + p, and (2) D + D → He3 + n. The tritium can be generated via the reaction channel '(1)' and the 2.45 MeV neutrons from '(2)' react with lithium-6 in the breeding blanket to produce more tritium to be fed back into plasma fuel. Quantitative evaluations are conducted for two blanket concepts to assess the feasibility and suitability of this approach to FPP reactors. The preliminary results suggest that initial operation in D-D with continual feedback into the plasma of the tritium produced enables a fusion reactor designed solely for D-T operation to start-up in an acceptably short time-scale without the need for any external tritium source.},

   abstract = {Any fusion power reactors such as “DEMO” that achieves tritium self-sufficiency with breeding blankets can produce tritium by DD reaction followed by exponential breeding in the blanket within reasonable total operation period. The present study further suggests that realistic Power Ascension Tests (PAT) of DEMO can produce its tritium to be needed in the series of tests by its own program until reaching steady state full power operation, with no external supply or additional operation costs. Closed tritium fuel plant was described by a system dynamics model, and analyzed considering realistic PATs of DEMO, that will be mainly pulsed DD and low concentration DT. Typical PATs require years of operation from zero power criticality to full power, with pulsed power output and long dwell time between them. Output power is gradually increased in PATs to check the functions of reactor systems and components. In the case of fusion DEMO, zero power criticality corresponds to DD operation. While plasma may be fired in pulses, tritium plant is continuously operated to recover all the tritium produced by the DD and low DT burn. Depending on the different time constant of tritium retention in components, tritium is transferred by deuterium purge, and high concentration tritium is finally collected in the storage, to be available for the next tests at virtually no additional cost. Realistic “initial loading tritium” will be 100 g for commissioning of tritium plant far prior to the plasma operation.},

   abstract = {Full power operation of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) has been delayed and will now begin in 2035. Delays to the ITER schedule may affect the availability of tritium for subsequent fusion devices, as the global CANDU-type fission reactor fleet begins to phase out over the coming decades. This study provides an up to date account of future tritium availability by incorporating recent uncertainties over the life extension of the global CANDU fleet, as well as considering the potential impact of tritium demand by other fusion efforts. Despite the delays, our projections suggest that CANDU tritium remains sufficient to support the full operation of ITER. However, whether there is tritium available for a DEMO reactor following ITER is largely uncertain, and is subject to numerous uncontrollable externalities. Further tritium demand may come from any number of private sector “compact fusion” start-ups which have emerged in recent years, all of which aim to accelerate the development of fusion energy. If the associated technical challenges can be overcome, compact fusion programmes have the opportunity to use tritium over the next two decades whilst it is readily available, and before full power DT operation on ITER starts in 2035. Assuming a similar level of performance is achievable, a compact fusion development programme, using smaller reactors operating at lower fusion power, would require smaller quantities of tritium than the ITER programme, leaving sufficient tritium available for multiple concepts to be developed concurrently. The development of concurrent fusion concepts increases the chances of success, as it spreads the risk of failure. Additionally, if full tritium breeding capability is not expected to be demonstrated in DEMO until after 2050, an opportunity exists for compact fusion programmes to incorporate tritium breeding technology in nearer-term devices. DD start-up, which avoids the need for external tritium for reactor start-up, is dependent upon full tritium breeding capability, and may be essential for large-scale commercial roll-out of fusion energy. As such, from the standpoint of availability and use of external tritium, a compact route to fusion energy may be more advantageous, as it avoids longer-term complications and uncertainties in the future supply of tritium.},

This increases the plasma-wetted area by 2-3 times over all flux-expansion-only methods (e.g., plate near main X point, plate tilting, X divertor, and snowflake), decreases parallel heat flux and hence plasma temperature at plate, and increases connection length by 2-5 times.

   abstract = {Using a simple set of poloidal field coils, one can reach the situation in which the null of the poloidal magnetic field in the divertor region is of second order, not of first order as in the usual X-point divertor. Then, the separatrix in the vicinity of the null point splits the poloidal plane not into four sectors, but into six sectors, making the whole structure look like a snowflake (hence the name). This arrangement allows one to spread the heat load over a much broader area than in the case of a standard divertor. A disadvantage of this configuration is that it is topologically unstable, and, with the current in the plasma varying with time, it would switch either to the standard X-point mode, or to the mode with two X-points close to each other. To avoid this problem, it is suggested to have a current in the divertor coils that is roughly 5% higher than in an "optimum" regime (the one in which a snowflake separatrix is formed). In this mode, the configuration becomes stable and can be controlled by varying the current in the divertor coils in concert with the plasma current; on the other hand, a strong flaring of the scrape-off layer still remains in force. Geometrical properties of this configuration are analyzed. Potential advantages and disadvantages of this scheme are discussed. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

This paper considers the context of these cost increases, and describes a disaggregated levelised cost model used by the authors to explore the effect of different assumptions about the direction and scale of the major cost drivers. The paper identifies the competing upward and downward pressures on costs in the medium term, and discusses the range of future costs that emerges from the analysis. The paper goes on to analyse the implications of these cost projections for the policy support levels that offshore wind may require. The paper suggests that there are good reasons why it is reasonable to expect a gradual fall in costs in the period to the mid-2020s, although it is unlikely that costs will fall as rapidly as they have risen, or that it will be a smooth downward trajectory. A key challenge is to reconcile the scale and pace of development desired for UK offshore wind with the potential growth rate that the supply chain can sustain without creating upward pressure on costs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {PROCESS is a reactor systems code - it assesses the engineering and economic viability of a hypothetical fusion power station using simple models of all parts of a reactor system, from the basic plasma physics to the generation of electricity. It has been used for many years, but details of its operation have not been previously published. This paper describes some of its capabilities. PROCESS is usually used in optimisation mode, in which it finds a set of parameters that maximise (or minimise) a figure of merit chosen by the user, while being consistent with the inputs and the specified constraints. Because the user can apply all the physically relevant constraints, while allowing a large number of parameters to vary, it is in principle only necessary to run the code once to produce a self-consistent, physically plausible reactor model. The scope of PROCESS is very wide and goes well beyond reactor physics, including conversion of heat to electricity, buildings, and costs, but this paper describes only the plasma physics and magnetic field calculations. The capabilities of PROCESS in plasma physics are limited, as its main aim is to combine engineering, physics and economics. A model is described which shows the main plasma features of an inductive ITER scenario. Significant differences between the PROCESS results and the published scenario include the bootstrap current and loop voltage. The PROCESS models for these are being revised. Two new models for DEMO have been obtained. The first, DEMO A, is intended to be "conservative" in that it might be possible to build it using the technology of the near future. For example, since current drive technologies are not yet mature, only 12% of the current is assumed to be due to current drive. Consequently it is a pulsed machine, able to burn for only 1.65 hours at a time. Despite the comparatively large size (major radius is 9 m), the fusion power is only 1.95 GW. The assumed gross thermal efficiency is 33%, giving just 465 MW net electric power. The second, DEMO B, is intended to be "advanced" in that more optimistic assumptions are made. Comparison of DEMO A and B with a reference ITER scenario shows that current drive and bootstrap fraction need the most extrapolation from the perspective of plasma physics.},

   abstract = {PROCESS is a reactor systems code - it assesses the engineering and economic viability of a hypothetical fusion power station using simple models of all parts of a reactor system. PROCESS allows the user to choose which constraints to impose and which to ignore, so when evaluating the results it is vital to study the list of constraints used. New algorithms submitted by collaborators can be incorporated - for example safety, first wall erosion, and fatigue life will be crucial and are not yet taken into account. This paper describes algorithms relating to the engineering aspects of the plant. The toroidal field (TF) coils and the central solenoid are assumed by default to be wound from niobium-tin superconductor with the same properties as the ITER conductors. The winding temperature and induced voltage during a quench provide a limit on the current density in the TF coils. Upper limits are placed on the stresses in the structural materials of the TF coil, using a simple two-layer model of the inboard leg of the coil. The thermal efficiency of the plant can be estimated using the maximum coolant temperature, and the capacity factor is derived from estimates of the planned and unplanned downtime, and the duty cycle if the reactor is pulsed. An example of a pulsed power plant is given. The need for a large central solenoid to induce most of the plasma current, and physics assumptions that are conservative compared to some other studies, result in a large machine, with a cryostat 36 m in diameter. Multiple constraints, working together, restrict the parameter space of the optimised model. For example, even when the ratio of operating current to critical current in the TF coils is increased by a factor of five, the total coil cross-section decreases only a little, because of the need for copper stabiliser, insulation, and structural support. The result is that the plasma major radius hardly changes. It is these surprising results that justify the development of systems codes.},

To identify the difference in economic evaluation methods between the JAEA model and an internationally-authorized code, and verify its calculation functions, the generation cost of an advanced loop-type SFR system was evaluated using the JAEA model and the Generation IV Excel Calculations of Nuclear Systems (G4-ECONS) developed by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF). It was clarified that the JAEA model is influenced to higher degree by the discount rate. When the present value was not taken into account, the results of both methods were quite similar, but it was found that the sensitivity of the load factor is relatively larger the G4-ECONS than in the JAEA model.},

   abstract = {Nuclear fusion can be considered as a base-load power plant technology: High investment costs and limited operational flexibility require continuous operation. Wind and solar, on the other hand, as the putative main pillars of a future renewable energy system, are intermittent power sources. The resulting variations that occur on many different time scales require at first sight a rather flexible back-up system to balance this stochastic behavior. Fusion would appear not to be well suited for this task. The situation changes, however, if a large-scale renewable energy system is envisaged based on a transnational, or even transcontinental power grid. The present paper discusses a possible European power system in the year 2050 and beyond. A high percentage share of renewable energies and a strong power grid spanning the whole of Europe and involving neighboring countries, in particular those in North Africa, are assumed. The linear programming model URBS is used to describe the power system. The model optimizes the overall system costs and simulates power plant operation with an hourly resolution for one whole year. The geographical resolution is at least at the country level. The renewable technologies are modeled first on a more local level and then summed together at the country or regional level. The results indicate that the smoothing effects of the large-scale power grid transform the intermittent renewable supply, which is then more compatible with base-load power plants such as fusion reactors. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The SERF program (Socioeconomic Research on Fusion) was then started. In 2014, public awareness and acceptance of fusion energy was re-confirmed by EURO fusion as crucial, for both sociological research and the fusion community. Given that fusion is not a hot issue among most publics, it is little known and distant from daily life, properly researching public attitudes towards fusion entails important methodological challenges. To address these challenges, this paper uses a combined qualitative- quantitative approach to examine public attitudes towards fusion. Data were collected with open and closed questions included in a survey among Belgian adults (N = 365 respondents who said they had previously heard of fusion energy), using Computer Assisted Personal Interviews. The quantitative analysis showed that the most influential predictors of attitudes towards fusion are the attitudes towards nuclear energy, the attitudes towards science and technology, and the perceived importance of costs and time needed to develop fusion energy. Our qualitative evidence confirms that nuclear fission does play a key role in the sense making about fusion, as a key device to define fusion was its comparison with fission (either as a new, different, nuclear or as a still dangerous nuclear). The results also showed some evidence that a new ‘fusion brand’ emerged spontaneously among the survey participants; respondents who mobilised the new brand referred to fusion as endless and clean energy that could solve our energy problem, and as scientific progress. Based on results, we discuss implications for fusion research and development.},

Global negative CO2 emission in 2100 by drastic decarbonization of energy systems was required to achieve the 2 °C target, and fusion power plants were expected to be installed in the latter half of the 21st century mainly in countries with limited potentials of zero-emission energy sources, such as Japan, Korea, and Turkey, for cost-efficient climate change mitigation. If inexpensive power plants could be developed by enhanced R&D and advanced design in DEMO projects or if the establishment of fission plants in the future is low, fusion power generation will also be deployed in the EU28, India, and China. Further cost reduction by innovative design and alternative concepts are also essential to diffuse fusion plants in zero-emission resource-rich countries.},

Two main options are available to generate carbon free electricity: either to rely on renewable energy sources only, or to integrate renewables with a new generation of nuclear power plant, e.g. fusion power plant. In the former case a large storage capacity and/or dispatchable generation are required to compensate for the variable electricity generation. The size of the necessary storage systems and dispatchable power plants can be reduced if a base-load carbon free power technology is available, such as fusion. These options are analysed in this paper with the CO.ME.S.E. (COsto MEdio del Sistema Elettrico – Electric System Average Cost) code that assesses the hourly balance between load and generation, through a simplified dispatch model and the system costs, through a stochastic economic analysis. Two sets of power generation scenarios are considered in typical North and South-Europe cases. The study gives key indications to make fusion a cost-effective ingredient of a future European decarbonized power mix.},

The Monte Carlo method is used to perform stochastic analyses in order to assess the weight on the cost of electricity of uncertainties on technical and economical aspects. This study demonstrates that a stochastic approach offers a much better perspective over the spectrum of values that could be expected for the cost of electricity from fusion. Specifically, this analysis proves that the cost of electricity of the DEMO-like power plant studied could vary in quite large range, from nearly 2/3 to nearly 4 times the cost derived through a deterministic approach, by choosing reference values for all the stochastic parameters, taken from the literature.},

The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2 °C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

   abstract = {Long-term scenarios play an important role in research on global environmental change. The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Here we present one component of these pathways: the SSP narratives, a set of five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics, human development, economy and lifestyle, policies and institutions, technology, and environment and natural resources. We describe the methods used to develop the narratives as well as how these pathways are hypothesized to produce particular combinations of challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Development of the narratives drew on expert opinion to (1) identify key determinants of these challenges that were essential to incorporate in the narratives and (2) combine these elements in the narratives in a manner consistent with scholarship on their inter-relationships. The narratives are intended as a description of plausible future conditions at the level of large world regions that can serve as a basis for integrated scenarios of emissions and land use, as well as climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability analyses.},

In large, demographically diverse samples from the United Kingdom (N = 438) and Germany (N = 390), we show for the first time the stigmatizing impact that the proposed use of depleted uranium (DU) as a tritium fuel storage option for nuclear fusion has upon public attitudes towards nuclear fusion. Participants’ attitudes towards nuclear fusion in both cohorts were assessed at four time points within an online questionnaire-based survey: pre-information about nuclear fusion (Time 1); post-information about fusion (Time 2); pre-information about DU (Time 3); and post-information about DU (Time 4). Attitudes towards nuclear fusion were generally more positive in the UK; however, both the UK and German cohorts showed a similar ‘flip-flop’ pattern in opinions over time. Specifically, an initial improvement in attitudes (Time 1 – Time 2), which was taken as evidence of the value of delineating nuclear fusion from nuclear fission, was followed by a significant downturn (Time 2 – Time 3) upon the announcement that DU would be involved in fuel-storage. This downturn in attitudes was tied to participants’ initial negative cognitive and affective evaluations of DU. The stigmatizing impact was found to partially reverse (Time 3 – Time 4) following the provision of information about the nature and purpose of DU within fusion. The study findings have clear implications for public engagement and communication efforts relating to current and future nuclear fusion demonstration projects.},

However, in this paper, we argue that the field of innovation management has failed to fully benefit from the proliferation of relevant research because much of this work has not been sufficiently coherent and cumulative. One reason for this, we propose, is the propensity to follow and fit research and publications into contemporary fads rather than to ground work in more fundamental themes and challenges. We present two examples of such fads, open innovation and business model innovation, to illustrate the trend. Finally, we suggest some more fundamental integrating themes and management challenges, drawing upon the latest edition of Managing Innovation (Tidd, J and J Bessant (2018).

This report, submitted to FESAC July 31, 2003, and subsequently approved by them (Appendix B), presents FESAC's response to that charge. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This report examines the possibility of nonelectric applications of fusion. In particular, the FESAC was asked to consider "whether the Fusion Energy Sciences program should broaden its scope and activities to include nonelectric applications of intermediate-term fusion devices." During this process, the FESAC was asked to consider the following questions: What are the most promising opportunities for using intermediate-term fusion devices to contribute to the Department of Energy missions beyond the production of electricity? What steps should the program take to incorporate these opportunities into plans for fusion research? Are there any possible negative impacts to pursuing these opportunities, and are there ways to mitigate these possible impacts? The panel adopted the following three criteria to evaluate all of the nonelectric applications considered: 1. Will the application be viewed as necessary to solve a "national problem," or will the application be viewed as a solution by the funding entity? 2. What are the technical requirements on fusion imposed by this application with respect to the present state of fusion and the technical requirements imposed by electricity production? What research and development is required to meet these requirements and is it "on the path" to electricity production? 3. What is the competition for this application, and what is the likelihood that fusion can beat it?},

   abstract = {Fusion energy is often regarded as a long-term solution to the world's energy needs. However, even after solving the critical research challenges, engineering and materials science will still impose significant constraints on the characteristics of a fusion power plant. Meanwhile, the global energy grid must transition to low-carbon sources by 2050 to prevent the worst effects of climate change. We review three factors affecting fusion's future trajectory: (1) the significant drop in the price of renewable energy, (2) the intermittency of renewable sources and implications for future energy grids, and (3) the recent proposition of intermediate-level nuclear waste as a product of fusion. Within the scenario assumed by our premises, we find that while there remains a clear motivation to develop fusion power plants, this motivation is likely weakened by the time they become available. We also conclude that most current fusion reactor designs do not take these factors into account and, to increase market penetration, fusion research should consider relaxed nuclear waste design criteria, raw material availability constraints and load-following designs with pulsed operation.},

   abstract = {Predicting the amount of waste produced from a fusion power plant is vital to assess the likely environmental impact, disposal costs, and also to satisfy nuclear regulators. Inventory simulations are ideally suited to this task because they can be used to evolve in time, via numerically solving the ordinary differential rate equations, the chemical composition of reactor materials, both during operation, when exposed to neutron irradiation, and afterwards, during post-operation decay. The radiological response of the time-evolving material composition can then be used to assign a waste class to reactor components. Waste assessment has been performed for designs of the European demonstration power plant (DEMO) concept using the FISPACT-II inventory simulator, and using extensive Monte Carlo simulations of the neutron irradiation fields as input. The masses in each waste class (defined using the IAEA infrastructure) have been charted in time for in-vessel components (including the divertor and blanket), ex-vessel regions such as the coils, and for the reactor vacuum vessel (VV). Comparisons are made between the waste-class masses generated for different tritium breeding blanket concepts. Typical predictions include the observation that the majority of the VV will become low-level waste within 100 years, while plasma-facing components and tritium breeding units will remain classified as intermediate-level waste for longer. The waste classification implications of sub-dividing the large VV is considered, highlighting the potential benefits, for waste disposal and recycling prospects, of being able to separate low activity regions of a component from more active regions.},

   abstract = {We have considered a strategy for reducing the radioactive waste generated by the replacement of in-vessel components, such as blanket segments and divertor cassettes, for the fusion DEMO reactor. In the basic case, the main parameters of the DEMO reactor are a major radius of 8.2 m and a fusion power of 1.35 GW. Blanket segments and divertor cassettes should be replaced independently, as their lifetimes differ. A blanket segment comprises several blanket modules mounted to a back-plate. The total weight of an in-vessel component is estimated to be about 6,648 ton (1,575, 3,777, 372, and 924 ton of blanket module, back-plate, conducting shell, and divertor cassette, respectively). The lifetimes of a blanket segment and a divertor cassette are assumed to be 2.2 years and 0.6 years, respectively, and 52,487 tons of waste is generated over a plant life of 20 years. Therefore, there is a concern that the contamination-control area for radioactive waste may need to increase due to the amount of waste generated from every replacement. This paper proposes a management scenario to reduce radioactive waste. When feasible and relevant, back-plates of blanket segment and divertor cassette bodies (628 ton) should be reused. Using the three-dimensional neutron transportation code MCNP, the displacement per atom (DPA) of the SUS316LN back-plates is 0.2 DPA/year and that of the F82H cassette bodies is 0.6 DPA/year. Therefore, the reuse of back-plates and cassette bodies would be possible if re-welding points are arranged under neutron shielding. We found that radioactive waste could be reduced to 20 % when tritium breeding materials are recycled. Finally, we propose a design for the DEMO building that uses a hot cell and temporary storage.},

   abstract = {After decades of designing magnetic and inertial fusion power plants, it is timely to develop a new framework for managing the activated (and contaminated) materials that will be generated during plant operation and after decommissioning-a framework that takes into account the lessons learned from numerous international fusion and fission studies and the environmental, political, and present reality in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. This will clearly demonstrate that designers developing fusion facilities will be dealing with the back end of this type of energy production from the beginning of the conceptual design of power plants. It is becoming evident that future regulations for geological burial will be upgraded to assure tighter environmental controls. Along with the political difficulty of constructing new repositories worldwide, the current reality suggests reshaping all aspects of handling the continual stream of fusion active materials. Beginning in the mid 1980s and continuing to the present, numerous fusion designs examined replacing the disposal option with more environmentally attractive approaches, redirecting their attention to recycling and clearance while continuing the development of materials with low activation potential. There is a growing international effort in support of this new trend. In this paper, recent history is analyzed, a new fusion waste management scheme is covered, and possibilities for how its prospects can be improved are examined. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Lithium ceramic and beryllium based solid-type breeder blankets are an option for supplying the tritium required to sustain the DT plasma. This research investigates the time-varying tritium production in solid breeder blankets with different compositions. The breeder fraction was varied in conjunction with the Li6 enrichment. The parameter study considered 198 different blanket compositions for three blanket thicknesses. The cheapest configuration capable of meeting the tritium requirements were found. The cost of Li4SiO4 (including Li6 enrichment) and Be12Ti were considered. The time-varying tritium production of each blanket configuration was simulated using the interface code, FATI, that couples the radiation transport code MCNP 6 with the inventory code FISPACT-II. Economical blanket configurations capable of self-sufficiency were found. The cost of producing excess tritium for start-up inventories was found to be between $18,000 and $27,000 per g. Fitting functions to predict the time-averaged tritium breeding fraction and the tritium inventory at five years, were obtained for inclusion in the PROCESS systems code. PROCESS is now able to consider different breeding blanket compositions and thicknesses when assessing the engineering, physics and economic feasibility of reactor designs.},

   abstract = {The current breeding blankets proposed in the different conceptual fusion power plants are based mainly on the use of Li4SiO4 and/or Li2TiO3 as tritium breeder and Be/Be12Ti as neutron multiplier or an eutectic Li17Pb83 for as a hybrid tritium and neutron multiplier. While these materials offer some tritium breeding capabilities, some recent studies show that the tritium self-sufficiency may not be ensured with these materials due to the strong reduction of blanket coverage after the integration of other in-vessel reactor systems (heating and current drive, limiters, large or double-null divertor systems, etc.). Also, some materials like Be raises several key feasibility concerns. The goal of this paper is to perform an update of the screening for tritium breeder and neutron multiplier materials and to assess the tritium breeding performance of the selected compounds in order to reveal new options. As for the neutron multiplier materials, a new subdivision between solid and liquid multipliers is proposed. For the selected compounds, detailed 3D heterogeneous neutronic analyses have been performed with MCNP5-1.60 assuming the architecture of the current EU DEMO Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) as a benchmark breeding blanket. From the point of view of ceramic breeders, Li8ZrO6 has been found to outperform Li4SiO4 by more than 4% in terms of tritium breeding, having 6% higher melting point. From the point of view of solid neutron multipliers, Be12Cr, Be12V, Be13Zr and Be13Y show a similar performance as Be12Ti, while LaPb3, Zr5Pb4 and YPb2 offer a solution for a Be-free blanket. As for liquid multipliers, Pb in combination with a ceramic breeder shows a very promising option. Moreover, Pb compounds like Pb90Mn10 and Pb95Ba5 offer similar performance as Pb with a lower melting point (290 °C). Due to the significant advantages of molten Pb as neutron multiplier, future work will be conducted to define a design of a helium cooled Molten Lead Ceramic Breeder blanket, as simple, cost effective blanket concept.},

   abstract = {The erosion and high neutron flux in a fusion power plant results in the need for frequent remote replacement of the plasma facing components. This is a complex and time consuming remote handling operation and its duration directly affects the availability and therefore the commercial viability of the power plant. A tool is needed to allow the maintenance duration to be determined so that developments in component design can be assessed in terms of their effect on the maintenance duration. This allows the correct balance to be drawn between component cost and performance on the one hand and the remote handling cost and plant availability on the other. The work to develop this tool has begun with an estimate of the maintenance duration for a fusion power plant based on the EFDA DEMO WP12 pre-conceptual design studies [1]. The estimate can be readily adjusted for changes to the remote maintenance process resulting from design changes. The estimate uses data extrapolated from recorded times and operational experience from remote maintenance activities on the JET tokamak and other nuclear facilities. The Power Plant Conceptual Study from 2005 [2] proposes that commercial viability of a power plant would require an availability of 75% or above. Results from the maintenance estimate described in this paper suggest that this level of availability could be achieved for the planned maintenance using a highly developed and tested remote maintenance system, with a large element of parallel working and challenging but feasible operation times. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We use recent cost estimates for future fusion power plants in order to incorporate fusion into the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), a long-term energy and environment model used to study the interaction between technology, climate, and public policy. Results show that fusion's growth will depend on: the chosen carbon mitigation target (if any); the availability of competing carbon-neutral options for the provision of baseload electrical power, in particular nuclear fission as well as carbon capture and storage the chosen discount rate; the initial year of availability; and the assumed costs of fusion electricity. We quantify the present value of the fusion option while varying the assumptions about these other parameters, and we find that it is, in general for our range of assumptions, significantly larger than the estimated cost of a comprehensive R&D plan to develop fusion energy. The results emphasize the wisdom in hedging against uncertainty in future technology availability by pursuing the development of multiple options that could feasibly play a major role in the latter half of the century.},

   abstract = {Energy gain and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission of tokamak fusion power reactors are evaluated in this study compared with other reactor types, structural materials, and other Japanese energy sources currently in use. The reactors treated in this study are (1) a conventional physics performance international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER), like a reactor based upon the ITER engineering design activity (ITER-EDA), (2) a RS (reversed shear) reactor using the reversed shear safety-factor/plasma current profile, and (3) a ST (spherical torus) reactor based upon the final version of the advanced reactor innovative engineering study ST (ARIES-ST). The input energy and CO 2 emission from these reactors are calculated by multiplying the weight or cost of the fusion reactor components by the energy intensity and/or with the CO 2 intensity data, which are updated as often as possible. The ITER cost estimation is estimated based on the component unit costs. The following results were obtained: (1) The RS and the ST reactor can double the energy gain and reduce CO 2 emission by one-half compared with the ITER-like reactor. (2) Silicon carbide (SiC) used as the structural material of inner vessel components is best for energy gain and CO 2 emission reduction. (3) The ITER-like reactor is slightly superior to a photovoltaic (PV) with regard to CO 2 emission. (4) The energy gain and CO 2 emission intensity of the RS reactor and the ST reactor are as excellent as those of a fission reactor and a hydro-powered generator. These results indicate that a tokamak fusion power reactor can be one of the most effective power-generating technologies both in high-energy payback gains and reduction of CO 2 .},

Techno-economic analysis on the fusion-biomass hybrid system is performed to understand the hydrogen cost and the cost competitiveness as compared to other existing technologies. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin for biomass are chosen for the techno-economic analysis in addition to the municipal solid waste as another feedstock. Stoi-chiometric calculation for biomass conversion to hydrogen is employed. Nuclear fusion thermal heat capacity and its heat cost are selected based on literature survey. Gasification plant for hydrogen production is assumed to employ the bubbling fluidized bed gasifier, fed by 20.6 MJ/kg of biomass. The result shows that total syngas capacity is 203 PJ and 137 PJ of hydrogen is produced through a ceramic membrane for H 2 separation. The levelized cost of hydrogen is $2.45/kg and the estimated 90% confidence interval of the LCOH ranges from $1.87 to $3.24/kg. The LCOH locates at a competitive position among the existing technologies. The LCOH can further decreased with the development of carbon pricing by the time of fusion commercialization in 2050.

They are compared with electric boilers and central gas boilers in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and heating costs. The heating systems are dimensioned to supply the projected 2030 heat loads for two different land surface areas (extensive and compact). The key input data is the empirical residential and tertiary heat demand per square kilometre for 2015, extrapolated to 2030 to account for the potential decrease in the heat demand (energy-efficient buildings). Given the assumptions made in this paper, the heating system that obtains the best balance between CO2 emissions and heating cost relies on an NCHP located about 30 km from Lyon. Cases in which the heat has to be transported over longer distances are considered, hence providing insights for metropolitan areas with similar size and density as the Lyon area. Implications for stakeholders and policy makers are discussed, so that to optimize future French energy systems through the most efficient use of available technologies.},

   abstract = {Hydrogen has been dubbed the fuel of the future. As fossil fuel reserves become depleted and greenhouse gas emissions are reduced inline with the Kyoto protocol, alternative energy sources and vectors, such as hydrogen, must be developed. Hydrogen produced from water splitting, as opposed to from hydrocarbons, has the potential to be a carbon neutral energy solution. There are several methods to extract hydrogen from water, three leading candidates being high temperature electrolysis, the SI thermochemical cycle and the HyS hybrid thermochemical cycle. All three of these processes involve a section requiring very high temperatures. The Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR), a gas cooled Generation IV reactor, is ideally suited for providing this high temperature heat. Nuclear hydrogen production is being investigated around the world. The four leading consortiums are the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), PBMR/Westinghouse, GA, and AREVA NP/CEA/EDF. There are also many smaller R&D efforts focussing on the development of particular materials and components and on process flowsheeting. A nuclear hydrogen plant involves four key pieces of equipment: the VHTR, the hydrogen production plant (HPP), the intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) and the power conversion system (PCS). The choice of all four items varies dramatically between programmes. Both pebble bed and prismatic fuel block VHTRs are being developed, which can be directly or indirectly coupled to a HPP and PCS placed either in series or parallel. Either a Rankine steam cycle or a Brayton gas turbine cycle can be employed in the PCS. This report details the choices made and research being carried out around the world. Predicted process efficiencies and plant costs are currently at a preliminary stage and are very similar, regardless of the options chosen. The cost of hydrogen produced from water splitting using nuclear technologies is around $2/kg H2. This is competitive with hydrogen produced by other methods, particularly if carbon emissions are regulated and costed. The technological feasibility and testing of key components will be one of the determining factors in plant viability. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Estimates of the total jobs created as well as the average number of jobs created per million dollars spent are provided. The study shows that the 50 ARRA projects administered by NOAA in the first year and half generated a total of 1409 jobs. These habitat restoration projects created, on average, 17 jobs per million dollars spent which is similar to other conservation industries such as parks and land conservation, and much higher than other traditional industries including coal, gas, and nuclear energy generation. This suggests that habitat restoration is indeed an effective way to stimulate job creation. In addition, habitat restoration has longer-term economic benefits, including future job creation in rebuilt fisheries and coastal tourism, and benefits to coastal economies including higher property values and better water quality. Therefore, investing in blue infrastructure habitat restoration is a green opportunity benefiting coastal economies and societies in both the short and the long term.},

   abstract = {An analytical job creation model for the US power sector from 2009 to 2030 is presented. The model synthesizes data from 15 job studies covering renewable energy (RE), energy efficiency (EE), carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear power. The paper employs a consistent methodology of normalizing job data to average employment per unit energy produced over plant lifetime. Job losses in the coal and natural gas industry are modeled to project net employment impacts. Benefits and drawbacks of the methodology are assessed and the resulting model is used for job projections under various renewable portfolio standards (RPS), EE, and low carbon energy scenarios We find that all non-fossil fuel technologies (renewable energy, EE, low carbon) create more jobs per unit energy than coal and natural gas. Aggressive EE measures combined with a 30% RPS target in 2030 can generate over 4 million full-time-equivalent job-years by 2030 while increasing nuclear power to 25% and CCS to 10% of overall generation in 2030 can yield an additional 500,000 job-years. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {The original generic magnetic fusion reactor paper was published in 1986 for deuterium-tritium reactors. This update describes what has changed in 30 years. Notably, the construction of ITER is providing important benchmark numbers for technologies and costs. In addition, we use a more conservative neutron wall flux and fluence. But, these cost-increasing factors are offset by greater optimism on the thermal-electric conversion efficiency and potential availability. In addition, today's inflation and interest rates are low, leading to a cost of money well below that used in the original study. The main examples show the cost of electricity (COE) as a function of aspect ratio and neutron flux to the first wall. The dependence of the COE on availability, thermoelectric efficiency, electrical power output, and the present day's low interest rates is also discussed. Interestingly, at fixed aspect ratio there is a shallow minimum in the COE at neutron flux of 2.5 MW/m 2. The possibility of operating with only a small COE penalty at even lower wall loadings (to 1.0 MW/m 2 at larger plant size) and the possible use of niobium-titanium coils are also investigated. It should be emphasized that the variation in the COEs is important rather than their absolute values. Keywords-Magnetic fusion reactor, cost of electricity.

   abstract = {The complementary features of low-carbon power sources are a central issue in designing energy transition policies. The French current electricity mix is characterised by a high share of nuclear power which equalled 76% of the total electric production in 2015. With the increase in intermittent renewable sources, nuclear flexibility is examined as part of the solution to balance electricity supply and demand. Our proposed methodology involves designing scenarios with nuclear and intermittent renewable penetration levels, and developing residual load duration curves in each case. The load modulation impact on the nuclear production cost is estimated.This article shows to which extent the nuclear annual energy production will decrease with high shares of intermittent renewables (down to load factors of 40% for proactive assumptions). However, the production cost increase could be compensated by progressively replacing the plants. Moreover, incentives are necessary if nuclear is to compete with combined-cycle gas turbines as its alternative back-up option.In order to reconcile the social planner with plant operator goals, the solution could be to find new outlets rather than reducing nuclear load factors. Nuclear flexibility could then be considered in terms of using its power to produce heat or hydrogen.},

   abstract = {We explore the operations, balancing requirements, and costs of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council power system under a stringent greenhouse gas emission reduction target. We include sensitivities for technology costs and availability, fuel prices and emissions, and demand profile. Meeting an emissions target of 85% below 1990 levels is feasible across a range of assumptions, but the cost of achieving the goal and the technology mix are uncertain. Deployment of solar photovoltaics is the main driver of storage deployment: the diurnal periodicity of solar energy availability results in opportunities for daily arbitrage that storage technologies with several hours of duration are well suited to provide. Wind output exhibits seasonal variations and requires storage with a large energy subcomponent to avoid curtailment. The combination of low-cost solar technology and advanced battery technology can provide substantial savings through 2050, greatly mitigating the cost of climate change mitigation. Policy goals for storage deployment should be based on the function storage will play on the grid and therefore incorporate both the power rating and duration of the storage system. These goals should be set as part of overall portfolio development, as system flexibility needs will vary with the grid mix.},

NSTX-U will ultimately operate at up to 2 MA and 1 T with up to 12 MW of neutral beam injection power for 5 s. NSTX-U will operate in a regime where electromagnetic instabilities are expected to dominate transport, and beam-heated NSTX-U plasmas will explore a portion of energetic particle parameter space that is relevant for both -heated conventional and low aspect ratio burning plasmas. NSTX-U will also develop the physics understanding and control tools to ramp-up and sustain high performance plasmas in a fully-noninductive fashion. NSTX-U began research operations in 2016, but a failure of a divertor magnetic field coil after ten weeks of operation resulted in the suspension of operations and initiation of recovery activities. During this period, there has been considerable work in the area of analysis, theory and modeling of data from both NSTX and NSTX-U, with a goal of understanding the underlying physics to develop predictive models that can be used for high-confidence projections for both ST and higher aspect ratio regimes. These studies have addressed issues in thermal plasma transport, macrostability, energetic particlet-driven instabilities at ion-cyclotron frequencies and below, and edge and divertor physics.},

SPARC is designed as a high-field ($B_0 = 12.2$ T), compact ($R_0 = 1.85$ m, $a = 0.57$ m), superconducting, D-T tokamak with the goal of producing fusion gain $Q&gt;2$ from a magnetically confined fusion plasma for the first time. Currently under design, SPARC will continue the high-field path of the Alcator series of tokamaks, utilizing new magnets based on rare earth barium copper oxide high-temperature superconductors to achieve high performance in a compact device. The goal of $Q&gt;2$ is achievable with conservative physics assumptions ($H_\{98,y2\} = 0.7$) and, with the nominal assumption of $H_\{98,y2\} = 1$, SPARC is projected to attain $Q \approx 11$ and $P_\{\textrm \{fusion\}\} \approx 140$ MW. SPARC will therefore constitute a unique platform for burning plasma physics research with high density ($\langle n_\{e\} \rangle \approx 3 \times 10^\{20\}\ \textrm \{m\}^\{-3\}$), high temperature ($\langle T_e \rangle \approx 7$ keV) and high power density ($P_\{\textrm \{fusion\}\}/V_\{\textrm \{plasma\}\} \approx 7\ \textrm \{MW\}\,\textrm \{m\}^\{-3\}$) relevant to fusion power plants.

   abstract = {Desalination capacity has rapidly increased in the last decade because of the increase in water demand and a significant reduction in desalination cost as a result of significant technological advances, especially in the reverse osmosis process. The cost of desalinated seawater has fallen below US$0.50/m3 for a large scale seawater reverse osmosis plant at a specific location and conditions while in other locations the cost is 50% higher (US$1.00/m3) for a similar facility. In addition to capital and operating costs, other parameters such as local incentives or subsidies may also contribute to the large difference in desalted water cost between regions and facilities. Plant suppliers and consultants have their own cost calculation methodologies, but they are confidential and provide water costs with different accuracies. The few existing costing methodologies and software packages such as WTCost© and DEEP provide an estimated cost with different accuracies and their applications are limited to specific conditions. Most of the available cost estimation tools are of the black box type, which provide few details concerning the parameters and methodologies applied for local conditions. Many desalination plants built recently have greater desalinated water delivery costs caused by special circumstances, such as plant remediation or upgrades, local variation in energy costs, and site-specific issues in raw materials costs (e.g., tariffs and transportation). Therefore, the availability of a more transparent and unique methodology for estimating the cost will help in selecting an appropriate desalination technology suitable for specific locations with consideration of all the parameters influencing the cost. A techno-economic evaluation and review of the costing aspects and the main parameters influencing the total water cost produced by different desalination technologies are herein presented in detail. Some recent developments, such as the increase of unit capacity, improvements in process design and materials, and the use of hybrid systems have contributed to cost reduction as well as reduction in energy consumption. The development of new and emerging low-energy desalination technologies, such as adsorption desalination, will have an impact on cost variation estimation in the future. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Thermal desalination is an energy intensive process that satisfies its requirement from conventional fossil fuel sources. Current research efforts aim at finding alternatives for fossil fuels to power thermal desalination. Nuclear energy offers a feasible option for power cogeneration and production of fresh water due to the significant amount of recovered useful heat. The heat is exploited to produce steam and generate electricity on-site to power thermal and membrane desalination facilities. Large or small/medium nuclear reactors (SMR) can be used. This paper reviews the various aspects of nuclear desalination, the different nuclear reactors that have been coupled with desalination processes, and the hybrid desalination systems coupled with nuclear reactors. It also discusses the safety and public acceptance for the nuclear desalination practices as well as the latest economic studies and assessments for on –site nuclear desalination power plants. Ten main projects around the world are primarily operated as nuclear desalination plants. The major desalination processes coupled with nuclear SMRs are MSF, MED and RO. The cost of water production using nuclear desalination was estimated to range from 0.4 $/m3 to 1.8 $/m3 depending on the type of reactor and the desalination process used.},

This potential has been conclusively demonstrated in several countries, and is still being utilised, although to a very limited extent. This creates a major, mostly untapped potential for satisfying certain portion of energy needs of humankind without constructing separate facilities for that purpose, just basing on heat losses. The article discusses the conditions necessary to increase the number of such plants. Moreover history and current state of district cooling and heating systems in the world are discussed together with the expected trends of heat and cool generation. The set of information sketched above eventually allowed to formulate recommendations regarding locations of new cogeneration plants and ways of integrating already existing into the district heating and cooling systems. Alongside these points, the key objective is to present an up-to-date review of all district heating applications of nuclear power – both those built and planned, but cancelled, as according to the authors’ knowledge no such comprehensive review has been published in English in recent decades.},

   abstract = {The paper presents a concept of flexible nuclear co-generation. A plant operating according to the concept can vary its production of heat and electricity by utilising steam on different pressure levels. It is also connected to a district heating system and utilises a large-scale heat storage. France has set long-term targets to increase the share of solar and wind power in the power mix, consequently reducing the share of nuclear power. The flexible co-generation can help the nuclear fleet cope with this change while potentially reducing emissions from the heating sector. High utilisation rate, efficiency and more stable reactor output is targeted. The concept is studied with an optimisation model within the French operational environmental in three case studies of Paris, Lyon and Dunkirk. Total efficiencies of 70%, 54% and 34% are reached, respectively. Cases represent systems with different heat loads and distances from nearby DH systems. Result indicate that both operational flexibility and large-scale storages are heavily utilised. However, compared to the flexibility required by a high-renewable power system, the plants can only play a small part. Also, the current district heating systems need development to utilise a large-scale heat source such as nuclear co-generation.},

The reason for such a strong position is the great reliability and proof of such a mature technology. The installation cost of MSF plants has dramatically decreased in the past years despite a normal inflation increase. The reason for such a trend can not be justified only by the competition but must be the result of a better plant design, larger unit size and also on a more realistic approach to the requirements by the owners. This paper presents such an analysis and compares some past examples with most recent installations both in terms of technical requirements and installation costs. The water cost produced by MSF plants is almost in line with other technologies. The paper presents some examples and comparisons. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Vertical tubes, horizontal tubes and different types of submerged tubes have been commercialized and were used until 1960 when multi-stage flash (MSF) dominated the desalination market. MSF plants are presently the most widely used and are considered as reliable sources for the production of fresh water from the sea in Middle East countries, in general, and in the Gulf region, in particular. Development of MED in the last few years has brought this process to the point of competing technically and economically with the MSF process. Major features of the MED process are low primary energy consumption, low heat transfer area and high gain ratio. This paper discusses the general features of existing commercial MED plants and associated technical aspects related to steam, condensers, evaporators, pumps and capacity. It also discusses gain ratio, operating temperature, materials of construction, operation and maintenance of these plants, associated problems, and other available information. Attempts to identify areas of development are also presented.},

Water treatment membranes provide high flux and contaminant rejection ability and require good mechanical strength and durability. Thus, assessing the mechanical properties of water treatment membranes is critical not only to their design, but also for studying their failure mechanisms, including the surface damage, mechanical and chemical ageing, delamination and loss of dimensional stability of the membranes. The various experimental techniques to assess the mechanical properties of wastewater treatment and desalination membranes are reviewed. Uniaxial tensile test, bending test, dynamic mechanical analysis, nanoindentation and bursting tests are the most widely used mechanical characterization methods for water treatment membranes. Mechanical degradations induced by fouling, chemical cleaning as well as membrane delamination are then discussed. Moreover, in order to study the membranes mechanical responses under similar loading conditions, the stress-state of the membranes are analyzed and advanced mechanical testing approaches are proposed. Some perspectives are highlighted to study the structure-properties relationship for wastewater treatment and water desalination membranes.},

   abstract = {Reverse osmosis (RO) desalination is reported to reach 3.0kWh/m3 by a certain specific case, and an average product water cost close to 0.75US$/m3 was achieved. After the introduction of an energy recovery device, RO desalination has now reached a technical barrier in energy consumption. To allow for further improvement, two major research trends have recently been highlighted: (1) development of high flux RO membranes, and (2) development of new technologies such as membrane distillation (MD) and forward osmosis (FO). The performance of RO membranes has been improved from 6000 gallons per day (GPD) to 12,000 GPD, due to novel membrane fabrication technologies. Also, membrane modifications are being spotlighted utilizing aquaporin, carbon nanotube, graphene, and other materials. The world's first standalone FO desalination process, by Modern Water (Al Khaluf, Oman), with a capacity of 100m3/d, has demonstrated its potential for commercial application. Nonetheless, FO still lacks economic feasibility due to the inefficiency in draw solute recovery. MD has a high potential to replace prevailing thermal desalination technologies, but in order for it to be economically feasible, a reliable (low grade) heat source is required. Such alternative desalination technologies currently have drawbacks in replacing RO desalination, thus hybridization with RO desalination is now consistently addressed for practical application: FO-RO, utilizing FO as pretreatment for RO or for reducing energy consumption in RO, RO-MD hybrid for improving RO recovery, or RO-PRO (pressure retarded osmosis) hybrid for converting chemical potential to electrical energy. Such hybridizations have just started to be considered in research laboratories and pilot plants, but guidelines for design, operation, and maintenance of such processes are yet to be established.},

   abstract = {Desalination is a method for producing water for human consumption, irrigation or industrial utilisation. In this study, a reverse osmosis (RO) system for brackish water desalination was theoretically investigated to produce both potable drinking and agricultural water with a lower overall and specific energy consumption. As a case study, the Main Outfall Drain in Iraq is used as the brackish water source. A numerical model based on solution-diffusion theory was developed in Matlab Simulink and used to analyse the design and performance of an RO system. The effect of feed water temperature, pressure, salinity and recovery ratio on the efficiency of the whole RO system was investigated for a wide range of design considerations. The design of an RO system for this application was optimised and economic assessment carried out. Results show that with boosting recovery ratio from 30% to 60%, the specific energy of desalinated water production below 400 ppm was reduced from 2.8 kWh/m3 to a more economically favourable value of 0.8 kWh/m3, when utilizing a pressure exchanger as a recovery device. Salt rejection was reduced from 97% to 88% to obtain large quantities of water for irrigation with an acceptable salinity (< 1600 ppm), for agricultural use. The reduction in salt rejection is influenced by the feed water temperature and pressure; also the average pore diameter of the RO membrane and in turn determines the reduction in system energy consumption. It was found that the total cost to produce 24,000 m3/d of water from a feed salinity of 15,000 ppm and a water quality of < 400 ppm would be 0.11 /m3 with a corresponding investment cost of 14.4 million for the drinking water, and for irrigation) obtained product < 1600 ppm) are 0.9/m3 and 11.3 million.},

   abstract = {Ion exchange membranes have been applied for water desalination since the 1950s in a process called electrodialysis, ED. Parallel to the transport of ions across ion exchange membranes, water molecules are transported from diluate to concentrate compartments reducing ED efficiency. In this study tailor made meshed membranes were prepared by embedding polymeric meshes with significantly reduced open area into an ion conductive polymer. These membranes were characterized to assess their transport properties. It is shown that by changing mesh open area, material and surface properties, it is possible to significantly reduce osmotic water transport. Polyamide mesh embedded in a cation exchange polymer showed an eightfold decrease of the water mass transport coefficient. Unexpectedly, osmotic water transport was not affected when the same mesh material was embedded in an anion exchange polymer. A decrease of the osmotic water transport for meshed anion exchange membranes was achieved by using a polyethylene terephthalate mesh. Despite the associated electrical resistance increase, application of meshed membranes increased diluate yield and allowed for more energy efficient operation in case ED is confined to a low current density regime.},

   abstract = {Many regions of the world are facing formidable freshwater scarcity. Although there is substantial scope for economizing on the consumption of water without affecting its service level, the main response to water scarcity has been to increase the supply. To a large extent, this is done by transporting water from places where it is abundant to places where it is scarce. At a smaller scale and without a lot of public and political attention, people have started to tap into the sheer limitless resource of desalinated water. This study looks at the development of desalination and its costs over time. The unit costs of desalinated water for five main processes are evaluated, followed by regressions to analyze the main influencing factors to the costs. The unit costs for all processes have fallen considerably over the years. This study suggests that a cost of $1/m3 for seawater desalination and $0.6/m3 for brackish water would be feasible today. The costs will continue to decline in the future as technology progresses. In addition, a literature review on the costs of water transport is conducted in order to estimate the total cost of desalination and the transport of desalinated water to selected water stress cities. Transport costs range from a few cents per cubic meter to over a dollar. A 100 m vertical lift is about as costly as a 100 km horizontal transport ($0.05-0.06/m3). Transport makes desalinated water prohibitively expensive in highlands and continental interiors but not elsewhere. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.},

   abstract = {Rising water demands and diminishing water supplies are exacerbating water scarcity in most world regions. Conventional approaches relying on rainfall and river runoff in water scarce areas are no longer sufficient to meet human demands. Unconventional water resources, such as desalinated water, are expected to play a key role in narrowing the water demand-supply gap. Our synthesis of desalination data suggests that there are 15,906 operational desalination plants producing around 95 million m3/day of desalinated water for human use, of which 48% is produced in the Middle East and North Africa region. A major challenge associated with desalination technologies is the production of a typically hypersaline concentrate (termed ‘brine’) discharge that requires disposal, which is both costly and associated with negative environmental impacts. Our estimates reveal brine production to be around 142 million m3/day, approximately 50% greater than previous quantifications. Brine production in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait and Qatar accounts for 55% of the total global share. Improved brine management strategies are required to limit the negative environmental impacts and reduce the economic cost of disposal, thereby stimulating further developments in desalination facilities to safeguard water supplies for current and future generations.},

The technology of thermal networks that work at a temperature close to the ground, can strongly contribute to the decarbonisation of the heating and cooling sector and furthermore exploit a multitude of low temperature heat sources. Nevertheless, the nomenclature used in literature shows that misinterpretations could easily result when comparing the different concepts of thermal networks that operate at a temperature level lower than traditional district heating. The scope of this work is to revise the definitions encountered and to introduce an unambiguous definition of Fifth-Generation District Heating and Cooling networks. A drawback-benefit analysis is presented to identify the pros and cons of such technology. The survey on the current networks shows that on average three Fifth-Generation District Heating and Cooling systems per year have entered the heating and cooling market in the last decade. Pioneer countries in such technology are Germany and Switzerland. For some networks, the assessed Linear Heating Power Demand Density results are lower than the feasibility threshold adopted in traditional district heating. High performances and low non-renewable primary energy factors are achieved in systems that exploit a very high share of renewable or urban excess heat sources. With respect to traditional district heating, the surveyed pumping energy consumptions result one order of magnitude higher, whereas the implemented control strategies can be completely different, leading the network temperature to float freely.},

The main global conclusions are low utilisation of district heating in buildings, varying implementation rates with respect to countries, moderate commitment to the fundamental idea of district heating, low recognition of possible carbon dioxide emission reductions, and low awareness in general of the district heating and cooling benefits. The cold deliveries from district cooling systems are much smaller than heat deliveries from district heating systems. The European situation can be characterised by higher commitment to the fundamental idea of district heating, lower specific carbon dioxide emissions, and higher awareness of the district heating and cooling benefits. The conclusions obtained from the six contexts analysed show that district heating and cooling systems have strong potentials to be viable heat and cold supply options in a future world. However, more efforts are required for identification, assessment, and implementation of these potentials in order to harvest the global benefits with district heating and cooling.},

District heating (DH) is a suitable technology to decarbonize the European heat sector. By contrast with most of nuclear non-electric applications, nuclear district heating (NDH) has already been implemented in Europe, thus providing us with some valuable empirical insights. This paper investigates the forces and obstacles to nuclear cogeneration by looking at the Loviisa 3 NDH project in Finland. The key forces are energy efficiency, decarbonization of the heat sector, operational competitiveness of future nuclear technologies, and synergies with renewable energies. The key obstacles are split incentives, electricity prices volatility, inexpediency of business models and regulatory frameworks, electioneering of local authorities and pessimist expectations with regards to project financing. Policy makers should recognize nuclear plants alongside other utilities generating large amounts of wasted heat. International cooperation programs involving both nuclear and heat stakeholders should be encouraged.

   abstract = {District Heating (DH) systems are commonly supplied using local heat sources. Nowadays, modern insulation materials allow for effective and economically viable heat transportation over long distances (over 20 km). The paper proposes a Decision Support System (DSS) for optimized selection of design and operating parameters of a long distance Heat Transportation System (HTS). The method allows for evaluation of feasibility and effectiveness of heat transportation from the considered heat sources to the given DH area. The optimized selection is formulated as the multicriteria decision-making problem. The constraints for this problem include a static HTS model, allowing considerations of the system life cycle, as well as time variability and spatial topology. Thereby, the variation of heat demand and ground temperature within the DH area, the insulation and pipe aging, as well as the terrain elevation profile are taken into account in the decision-making process. The HTS construction costs, the operating costs (pumping power), and the heat loss are considered as objective functions, while such parameters as: inner pipeline diameter, insulation thickness, temperature and pressure profiles, as well as pumping station locations are optimized during the decision-making process. Moreover, variants of pipe laying e.g. one pipeline with a larger diameter, or two parallel pipelines with smaller diameters might be considered during the optimization. The analyzed optimization problem is multicriteria, hybrid and nonlinear. The genetic solver has been proposed to solve it.},

The selection was made in collaboration with ‘the Ad-Hoc Expert Group on the Role and Economics of Nuclear Cogeneration in a Low Carbon Energy Future’ from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Firstly, the linear heat density of the modelled DH networks was determined, including locations with poorly developed DH networks. A large potential for extending DH networks was identified for France and the United Kingdom despite the expected decrease in the heat demand due to building renovation. Secondly, the costs and GHG emissions of DH + NCHP systems were evaluated via a cost-benefit analysis. It concluded that 7 of the 15 projects would be cost-effective if 25% of the total urban heat demand was supplied. Implementing NCHP-based systems would reduce GHG emissions by approximately 10 Mt eCO2/a. Four additional DH + NCHP systems could become competitive if a larger share of the total demand was supplied. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the uncertainty affecting the key parameters.},

Given the abundance of WH from NPPs and the ubiquity of generally low-grade heat requirements of agricultural operations, from production to post-harvest, there is remarkable potential to harness NPP WH for agricultural uses with mutual economic advantages to NPPs and agricultural sectors. Taking advantage of this WH resource may improve the financial outlook of both the partnered power plants and agricultural businesses by providing an additional revenue stream, decreased heating costs, and a reduced carbon footprint. This review summarizes and interprets the historical discourse and research on agricultural applications of NPP WH in the U.S., and synthesizes technical constraints, unknowns, and opportunities for realizing the benefits of WH derived from the nuclear energy sector for agricultural value chains. Previous applications of WH in the agricultural industry demonstrate that this is a viable option to the benefit of the parties involved under the right conditions, but relatively little has been done to further this technology in the U.S. in recent years or explore novel applications. A revival of interest in this technology may be warranted given the current outlook for NPPs in the U.S. and a general interest in reducing the environmental impact of agriculture.},

   abstract = {The next generation nuclear plant (NGNP) will most likely produce electricity and process heat, with both being considered for hydrogen production. To capture nuclear process heat, and transport it to a distant industrial facility requires a high temperature system of heat exchangers, pumps and/or compressors. The heat transfer system is particularly challenging not only due to the elevated temperatures (up to ∼1300 K) and industrial scale power transport (≥50 MW), but also due to a potentially large separation distance between the nuclear and industrial plants (100+ m) dictated by safety and licensing mandates. The work reported here is the preliminary analysis of two-phase thermosyphon heat transfer performance with alkali metals. A thermosyphon is a thermal device for transporting heat from one point to another with quite extraordinary properties. In contrast to single-phased forced convective heat transfer via 'pumping a fluid', a thermosyphon (also called a wickless heat pipe) transfers heat through the vaporization/condensing process. The condensate is further returned to the hot source by gravity, i.e., without any requirement of pumps or compressors. With this mode of heat transfer, the thermosyphon has the capability to transport heat at high rates over appreciable distances, virtually isothermally and without any requirement for external pumping devices. Two-phase heat transfer by a thermosyphon has the advantage of high enthalpy transport that includes the sensible heat of the liquid, the latent heat of vaporization, and vapor superheat. In contrast, single-phase forced convection transports only the sensible heat of the fluid. Additionally, vapor-phase velocities within a thermosyphon are much greater than single-phase liquid velocities within a forced convective loop. Thermosyphon performance can be limited by the sonic limit (choking) of vapor flow and/or by condensate entrainment. Proper thermosyphon requires analysis of both. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Studies on the various possibilities for the application of heat from nuclear reactors in the form of district heat or process steam for industrial purposes had been made long before the present energy crisis. Although these studies have indicated technical feasibility and economical justification of such utilization, the availability of relatively cheap oil and difficulties in locating a nuclear heat source inside industrial areas did not stimulate much further development. Since the increase of oil prices, the interest in nuclear heat application is reawakened, and a number of new potential areas have been identified. It now seems generally recognized that the heat from nuclear reactors should play an important role in primary energy supply, not only for electricity production but also as direct heat. At present three broad areas of nuclear heat application are identified (see Fig.): • Direct heat utilization in industrial processing requiring a temperature above 800°C; • Process steam utilization in various industries, requiring a temperature mainly in the range of 200-300°C; • Low temperature and waste heat utilization from nuclear power plants for desalination of sea water and district heating. Such classification is mainly related to the type and characteristics of the heat source or nuclear reactor which could be used for a particular application. Modified high temperature reactor types (HTR) are the candidates for direct heat application, while the LWR reactors can satisfy most of the demands for process steam. Production of waste heat is a characteristic of all thermal power plants, and its utilization is a major challenge in the field of power production. In all of the identified areas of nuclear heat utilization, activities at present are mainly limited to studies aimed at demonstrating the economical advantages of conventional fuel use against production costs and fossil fuel savings. Studies are also oriented to conceptual design of heat sources such as Very High Temperature Reactors (VHTR) for the production of heat of required temperatures, and to industrial installations for particular heat application. Problems are faced when conventional heat utilization processes have to be coupled to a new heat source with different characteristics of heat transfer media and constraints imposed on their outlet temperature. Both the heat source and the transfer process must be accommodated with a specific design of interfaces to allow the transfer of heat from the reactor. The safety aspects of using nuclear heat are also of concern. To facilitate heat transfer the heat source should be located close to the industrial installations, which are usually in densely populated areas. 33},

   abstract = {<p>The steel industry, as a major consumer of coking coal and hydrocarbons, is exploring ways to reduce its dependence on these potentially expensive raw materials by making direct use of nuclear heat. Of the present two routes for producing steel, the major one (the hot metal route) employing the blast furnace which reduces iron ore to yield molten iron which is subsequently refined by basic oxygen steelmaking, does not lend itself to the application of nuclear heat; in the second (the cold metal route) recycled steel-or a substitute-is melted in an arc furnace where already today a proportion of the electricity used is generated in nuclear power stations. The development of ‘direct reduction’ processes allows iron ore to be converted to a solid pre-reduced iron product. In the conventional prereduction process, fossil fuels are used as both fuel and as chemical reductant. With nuclear heat, the fossil fuel-re-formed to a suitable reductant-is confined to the chemical role and not used as a source of heat. This reduction stage would be followed by arc melting, as in the present cold metal route. This basic process, which at present constitutes the minor route, could become the major one for the manufacture of steel in the long term.

   abstract = {High temperature nuclear reactors will mainly address the market of industrial cogeneration. This market is a part of the overall market of the heat concretely consumed by industry, in particular heat intensive industries. In simpler terms, the HTR market is a part of the industrial cogeneration market, which itself is a part of the industrial heat market. The EU-supported project EUROPAIRS (2009-2011) has therefore carried out a comprehensive study of the complete European industrial heat market in order to prepare for the deployment of HTRs. This information did not exist priori to the study. The purposes of this paper are (1) to present the methodology of the study and the experience gathered in order to exchange with non-European equivalent or future initiatives (beyond the discussions already engaged with the US), (2) to synthesise the quantitative results of the study and (3) to briefly report on the cogeneration usages in several key industries (e.g. chemicals, refining, steelmaking...) which may affect HTR designing. The paper finishes with some reflection on the part of the heat market that HTRs could potentially address. In correlation with our other paper on the pre-economic analysis, this paper intend to pave the way for an international cooperation on evaluating the market for HTR worldwide, which is an information of common interest to the HTR community. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {There is growing interest in the use of advanced reactor systems for powering industrial processes which could significantly help to reduce CO2 emissions in the global energy system. However, there has been limited consideration into the role nuclear power would play in meeting current and future industry heat demand, especially with respect to the advantages and disadvantages nuclear power offers relative to other competing low-carbon technologies, such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). In this study, the current market needs for high temperature heat are considered based on UK industry requirements and work carried out in other studies regarding how industrial demand could change in the future. How these heat demands could be met via different nuclear reactor systems is also presented. Using this information, it was found that the industrial heat demands for temperature in the range of 500 ◦C to 1000 ◦C are relatively low. Whilst High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs), Very High Temperature Reactors (VHTRs), Gas-cooled Fast Reactors (GFRs) and Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) have an advantage in terms of capability to achieve higher temperatures (>500 ◦C), their relative benefit over Liquid Metal-cooled Fast Reactors (LMFRs) and Light Water Reactors (LWRs) is actually smaller than previous studies indicate. This is because, as is shown here, major parts of the heat demand could be served by almost all reactor types. Alternative (non-nuclear) means to meet industrial heat demands and the indirect application of nuclear power, in particular via producing hydrogen, are also considered. As hydrogen is a relatively poor energy carrier, current trends indicate that the use of low-carbon derived hydrogen is likely to be limited to certain applications and there is a focus in this study on the emerging demands for hydrogen.},

The modest decline occurred largely in non-energy-intensive industries. To align with the SDS, industry emissions must fall by 1.2% annually to 7.4 GtCO2 by 2030 – despite expected industrial production growth. Greater energy efficiency, the uptake of renewable fuels, and research and deployment of low-carbon process routes including CCS are all critical. Governments can accelerate progress by providing innovation funding and adopting mandatory CO2 emissions reduction and energy efficiency policies.

BNs also have a modular architecture that facilitates iterative model development. For a model to be of value in generating and sharing knowledge or providing decision support, it must be built using good modelling practice. This paper provides guidelines to developing and evaluating Bayesian network models of environmental systems, and presents a case study habitat suitability model for juvenile Astacopsis gouldi, the giant freshwater crayfish of Tasmania. The guidelines entail clearly defining the model objectives and scope, and using a conceptual model of the system to form the structure of the BN, which should be parsimonious yet capture all key components and processes. After the states and conditional probabilities of all variables are defined, the BN should be assessed by a suite of quantitative and qualitative forms of model evaluation. All the assumptions, uncertainties, descriptions and reasoning for each node and linkage, data and information sources, and evaluation results must be clearly documented. Following these standards will enable the modelling process and the model itself to be transparent, credible and robust, within its given limitations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The book addresses not only the science and technology of fusion commercialisation, but also the associated innovation management.The first section of the book provides an introduction to private fusion and explains that the marketed product will not necessarily be electricity. The policy context of a global need for decarbonisation is introduced and compared to the timescales of fusion commercialisation. The second section introduces some of the leading private sector initiatives in fusion from around the world. Then, the third section outlines the public sector's ongoing efforts toward commercialisation. And finally, the fourth section discusses the challenges and future opportunities of private fusion.},

   abstract = {The concept leading to a hydrogen economy lay in the work of a Nazi engineer, Lawaceck, 1968. I heard his suggestion of cheaper transfer of energy in hydrogen through pipes at a dinner in that year. A paper was published with Appleby in 1972 which was the first published document concerning that title and involving the title of A Hydrogen Economy. The first meeting was in Cornell University in 1973. In 1974 T. Nejat Veziroglu organized the first big meeting on hydrogen (900 attendees). At this meeting I presented privately to Veziroglu the possibilities of a world development and he told me that he was ready to put his organizing ability to use in spreading the ideas worldwide. However, he not only proceeded to do this but he, also a professor at the University of Miami, contributed several papers of notes, particularly the one with Awad of 1974 about the cost of pollution. Gregory worked at the Gas Research Institute from 1971 and confirmed the expectations put down by Lawaceck. Veziroglu founded the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy in 1974. Research in hydrogen was relatively low cost and therefore was taken up most eagerly by those from the newer countries. The National Science Foundation awarded Texas A&M University in 1982 a five year support for hydrogen as a fuel with the condition that half the costs be borne by at least five industrial companies. I was appointed director of the research under the grant and chose to concentrate upon the decomposition of water by solar light via an electrochemical photo fuel cell. We were able to obtain considerable increases in efficiency of decomposition of water by solar light, and at the time the work was interrupted we had 9.6 percent efficiency for decomposition. S.U.M. Khan and R. Kainthla were the principal contributors to the theory of using light via electrochemical cells for this purpose. The Texas A&M University work on hydrogen was interrupted in 1989 by the arrival of claims that one of my former students had carried out electrolysis of deuterium oxide saying that an extra unexplained heat had been observed and he suggested this heat was nuclear in origin. Later, seeking to reduce the cost of hydrogen as a fuel I involved Sol Zaromb in discussions and we came across the idea that if one included a carbon dioxide molecule obtained by removing it from the atmosphere in the structure of methanolAT, no increase in global warming would occur from the use of methanol with that condition, (published in 2008). By this condition methanol took on the largest advantage of gaseous hydrogen: That it did not cause global warming. The estimated cost of the new (anti-global warming) fuel, methanol AT was less than $30/GJ. This estimated cost could be compared with the $48/GJ which is now being supported by a French Canadian group who published an attractive book with six pages of calculations of costs. The difference between the cost estimated by this group and the costs which have been assumed by hydrogen enthusiasts in earlier times was that they took into account the auxiliary expenses which would come with the use of hydrogen, in particular the storage at high pressure. The characteristics of the new methanol to cause no global warming put that aspect of it on an equal footing to the gaseous hydrogen. The CO2 which was an essential part of the structure of methanolAT was necessary to be created in a stream, rather than directly from the atmosphere, but it was easily shown that this could be done by the use of biomass and by carbonaceous wastes. A German team under Weiderman and Grob appeared in 2008 and proceeded to suggest some extensions of the ideas which had been undergoing publication for some time. The aim of the German work was to reduce costs of a compound which they called Methasyn. The present situation is that the claim of methanolAT as a world fuel to be used without any concerns of exhaustion or pollution depends on the commercial point of view of the costs being less than that of obtaining oil from the tar sands.

A techno-economical evaluation of the system when cost of producing hydrogen and hydrogen load (fuel cell vehicle quantities) changes is also presented, taking into consideration the future progress of the technology and its market development. Techno-economic analysis of WCHPFCVS is shown as an effective method through a case study using actual data of curtailment from a wind farm in Jilin province in northeast China.},

This review highlights current means for hydrogen production and use, and the importance of progressing R&D along key technologies and policies to drive a cost reduction in renewable hydrogen production and enable the transition of chemical manufacturing toward green hydrogen as a feedstock and fuel. The chemical industry is at the core of what is considered a modern economy. It provides commodities and important materials, e.g., fertilizers, synthetic textiles, and drug precursors, supporting economies and more broadly our needs. The chemical sector is to become the major driver for oil production by 2030 as it entirely relies on sufficient oil supply. In this respect, renewable hydrogen has an important role to play beyond its use in the transport sector. Hydrogen not only has three times the energy density of natural gas and using hydrogen as a fuel could help decarbonize the entire chemical manufacturing, but also the use of green hydrogen as an essential reactant at the basis of many chemical products could facilitate the convergence toward virtuous circles. Enabling the production of green hydrogen at cost could not only enable new opportunities but also strengthen economies through a localized production and use of hydrogen. Herein, existing technologies for the production of renewable hydrogen including biomass and water electrolysis, and methods for the effective storage of hydrogen are reviewed with an emphasis on the need for mitigation strategies to enable such a transition.},

Projections are made for the demand and supply of hydrogen as chemical feedstock in the U.S.A. Industrial sectors considered are petroleum refining, ammonia synthesis, methanol production, isocyanate manufacture, edible oil processing, coal liquefaction, fuel cell electricity generation, anddirect iron reduction. Presently, almost all the hydrogen required is produced by the reforming of natural ga~ or petroleum fractions. Specific needs and emphasis are recommended for future reseach and development to produce hydrogen from other sources, such as coal and nonfossit systems, to meet the requirements of these industrial sectors.

By renewable H 2 utilization on blast furnace (BF), it is expected to achieve both sustainable operation and CO 2 emission reduction. We evaluate the application of the solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) process as a source of H 2 for use as an alternative to CO as the reductant in a BF. We mathematically formulated a BF model and developed an integrated BF-SOEC process. We performed techno-economic analysis to suggest the maximum H 2 injection for the technical aspect, and demonstrated the process' economic viability, considering the learning-by-doing effects on the price of the SOEC system. We also estimated the net reduction of global warming potentials and carbon intensity. Our findings showed that the coke replacement ratio ranged from 0.255 ~ 0.334 kg Coke •kg 1 H2 depending on injection conditions and that 25 kg H2 • t 1 HM was an acceptable maximum injection rate within the stable range of BF operating indexes. We calculated H 2 production cost to be US$ 8.84 ~ 8.88 kg 1 H2 in the present, but it is expected to be decreased to US$ 1.41 ~ 4.04 kg 1 H2 by 2050. Economic parity with the existing BF process will be reached between the years 2036 and 2045, depending on the maturity of the SOEC process. Injection of 25 kg H2 •t 1 HM can reduce CO 2 emission by 0.26 ~ 0.32 t CO2 eq. •t 1 HM We expect that this sustainable strategy to reduce CO 2 emission from integrated mill plants will widen applications of H 2 utilization in BFs if the economic efficiency of SOEC systems can be increased.},

   abstract = {Production of iron and steel releases seven percent of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Incremental changes in present primary steel production technologies would not be sufficient to meet the emission reduction targets. Replacing coke, used in the blast furnaces as a reducing agent, with hydrogen produced from water electrolysis has the potential to reduce emissions from iron and steel production substantially. Mass and energy flow model based on an open-source software (Python) has been developed in this work to explore the feasibility of using hydrogen direct reduction of iron ore (HDRI) coupled with electric arc furnace (EAF) for carbon-free steel production. Modeling results show that HDRI-EAF technology could reduce specific emissions from steel production in the EU by more than 35%, at present grid emission levels (295 kgCO 2 /MWh). The energy consumption for 1 ton of liquid steel (tls) production through the HDRI-EAF route was found to be 3.72 MWh, which is slightly more than the 3.48 MWh required for steel production through the blast furnace (BF) basic oxygen furnace route (BOF). Pellet making and steel finishing processes have not been considered. Sensitivity analysis revealed that electrolyzer efficiency is the most important factor affecting the system energy consumption, while the grid emission factor is strongly correlated with the overall system emissions.},

This review examines the potential benefits of these technologies across different markets, particularly the current state of development and performance of fuel cell micro-CHP. Fuel cells offer some important benefits over other low-carbon heating technologies, and steady cost reductions through innovation are bringing fuel cells close to commercialisation in several countries. Moreover, fuel cells offer wider energy system benefits for high-latitude countries with peak electricity demands in winter. Hydrogen is a zero-carbon alternative to natural gas, which could be particularly valuable for those countries with extensive natural gas distribution networks, but many national energy system models examine neither hydrogen nor fuel cells for heating. There is a need to include hydrogen and fuel cell heating technologies in future scenario analyses, and for policymakers to take into account the full value of the potential contribution of hydrogen and fuel cells to low-carbon energy systems.},

   abstract = {Since the beginning of the twenty-first century the limitations of the fossil age with regard to the continuing growth of energy demand, the peaking mining rate of oil, the growing impact of CO 2 emissions on the environment and the dependency of the economy in the industrialized world on the availability of fossil fuels became very obvious. A major change in the energy economy from fossil energy carriers to renewable energy fluxes is necessary. The main challenge is to efficiently convert renewable energy into electricity and the storage of electricity or the production of a synthetic fuel. Hydrogen is produced from water by electricity through an electrolyser. The storage of hydrogen in its molecular or atomic form is a materials challenge. Some hydrides are known to exhibit a hydrogen density comparable to oil; however, these hydrides require a sophisticated storage system. The system energy density is significantly smaller than the energy density of fossil fuels. An interesting alternative to the direct storage of hydrogen are synthetic hydrocarbons produced from hydrogen and CO 2 extracted from the atmosphere. They are CO 2 neutral and stored like fossil fuels. Conventional combustion engines and turbines can be used in order to convert the stored energy into work and heat. 1. Energy and development (a) Growing energy demand Human beings developed on Earth based on plants, i.e. biomass, as the only energy carrier. The consumption of plants did not change the environment because the carbon dioxide that was liberated by the humans and animals was reabsorbed by the plants during the process of photosynthesis. In 1698, Thomas Savery built a simple steam engine able to pump water. Thomas Newcomen in 1712 developed an improved steam engine (Wilson 1981) able to deliver mechanical work.

   abstract = {The sheared-flow-stabilized (SFS) Z-pinch is a promising confinement concept for the development of a compact fusion reactor. The Z-pinch has been theoretically and experimentally shown to be stable to magnetohydrodynamic modes when sufficient radial shear of the axial flow is present. At the University of Washington, the Fusion Z-pinch Experiment (FuZE) research project examines scaling the SFS Z-pinch toward fusion conditions. The FuZE device produces long-duration, 50-cm-long pinches with measured ion and electron temperatures over 1 keV and number densities greater than 10 17 cm À3. Plasma properties are measured with a diagnostic suite that includes magnetic field probes, heterodyne quadrature interferometry, digital holographic interferometry, ion-Doppler spectroscopy, and fast framing photography. Neutrons are produced in the FuZE device when deuterium is injected along with the normal hydrogen or helium fueling species. Neutron generation is diagnosed using plastic scintillator detectors. The neutron production is sustained for 5 to 8 μs, thousands of times longer than the static Z-pinch instability growth time. Measured neutron production is consistent with calculated theoretical values for thermonuclear yield at the observed plasma temperatures and scales with the square of the deuterium concentration. A preliminary reactor concept is designed to incorporate flowing liquid metal walls, which would serve as an electrode, a heat transfer fluid, a radiological shield, and a breeding blanket. Using a liquid metal wall could address several unresolved material and technology issues in existing fusion reactor designs.},

Following this, experimental research on plasma initiation and heating in toroidal systems began in 1951 at the Kurchatov Institute. From the very first devices with vessels made of glass, porcelain or metal with insulating inserts, work progressed to the operation of the first tokamak, T-1, in 1958. More machines followed and the first international collaboration in nuclear fusion, on the T-3 tokamak, established the tokamak as a promising option for magnetic confinement. Experiments continued and specialized machines were developed to test separately improvements to the tokamak concept needed for the production of energy. At the same time, research into plasma physics and tokamak theory was being undertaken which provides the basis for modern theoretical work. Since then, the tokamak concept has been refined by a world-wide effort and today we look forward to the successful operation of ITER.},

There is a considerable demand for clean hydrogen pathways that are economically competitive with SMR. The development of a 563 MW integrated wind-hydrogen model with energy storage is proposed. The model utilizes real-time wind energy data to ascertain the optimal size of the electrolyser, the number of electrolyser units and the battery (energy storage) capacity that will yield a minimum hydrogen production cost, whilst functioning in a liberalized electricity market with dynamic prices. The optimal plant configuration consists of 81 units of a 3496 kW (760 Nm3/hr) electrolyser and 360 MWh (60 units) of battery capacity. For the minimum hydrogen production cost determined ($9.00//kg H2), the wind farm accounts for 63% of this cost. Hence, if existing wind farm assets are used, such that the investment cost of building the wind-hydrogen plant does not include the wind farm costs, the hydrogen production cost is reduced to $3.37/kg H2. For a particular electrolyser-battery configuration, it was observed that the minimum hydrogen production cost occurs when their respective capacity factors are approximately equivalent. The benefits of energy storage are limited by the decrease in overall plant efficiency, which results from the use of the battery. For the techno-economic conditions considered in this paper, hydrogen production costs from wind powered electrolysis ($3.37 to $9.00/kg H2) are uncompetitive with SMR/SMR-CCS ($1.87 to $2.60/kg H2).},

The wind-hydrogen plant proposed has a capacity of 563MW, along with the dual functionality of hydrogen production and electricity generation; with the delivery of hydrogen to the bitumen upgrader via pipeline. The research carried out involved the development of a data intensive techno-economic model in tandem with a simulation model of the plant. Several plant configurations were assessed to determine the optimum electrolyzer size and quantity - which would translate into the minimum hydrogen production cost (including delivery).

Therefore, currently, hydrogen production from wind energy remains uncompetitive relative to conventional fossil fuel hydrogen pathways. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Five models were developed for the use of biogas-based electricity and sewage sludge obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant for hydrogen production. These models included alkaline, PEM, high temperature water electrolysis, alkaline hydrogen sulfide electrolysis and dark fermentation biohydrogen production processes. Energy and economic analyses were performed on the models by applying thermodynamic procedures and the results were compared. The daily hydrogen production rates of the models were calculated as 594, 625.4, 868.6, 10.8 and 56.74 kg for models 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. The electricity costs of the models were calculated as 3.60, 3.43, 2.47, 1.16 and 6.7 $/kg-H2, for models 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. In terms of the hydrogen production rate, the high temperature electrolysis process was found to be superior to the other models, followed by the PEM electrolysis process, whereas, in terms of the hydrogen production cost, hydrogen sulfide electrolysis was found to be superior to the other models. This paper aimed to determine the most appropriate model for a wastewater treatment plant among the considered models in terms of both hydrogen production and hydrogen production cost.},

   abstract = {The hybrid sulphur process is one of the most promising thermochemical water splitting cycles for large scale hydrogen production. While the process includes an electrolysis step, the use of sulphur dioxide in the electrolyser significantly reduces the electrical demand compared to conventional alkaline electrolysis. Solar operation of the cycle with zero emissions is possible if the electricity for the electrolyser and the high temperature thermal energy to complete the cycle are provided by solar technologies. This paper explores the possible use of photovoltaics (PV) to supply the electrical demand and examines a number of configurations. Production costs are determined for several scenarios and compared with base cases using conventional technologies. The hybrid sulphur cycle has promise in the medium term as a viable zero carbon production process if PV power is used to supply the electrolyser. However, the viability of this process is dependent on a market for hydrogen and a significant reduction in PV costs to around $1/Wp. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The Hybrid Sulfur plant has been designed on the basis of results obtained from a new flowsheet ASPEN Plus® simulation, carrying out specific evaluations for the Sulfur dioxide Depolarized Electrolyzer, being developed and constructed at Savannah River National Laboratory, and for the sulfuric acid decomposition bayonet-based reactor, investigated at Sandia National Laboratory. Solar hydrogen production costs have been estimated considering two different scenarios in the medium to long term period, assuming the financing and economic guidelines from DOE's H2A model and performing ad hoc detailed evaluations for unconventional equipment. A minimum hydrogen production specific cost of 3.19 $/kg (2005 US $) has been assessed for the long term period.

Countries such as the UK, Turkey and emerging economies (i.e. Malaysia and Indonesia) are increasingly seeking to attract private investors for nuclear projects using project finance. This is an innovative approach, and until now the only cases registered are Hinckley Point C in the UK and Akkuyu in Turkey. This paper scrutinises the mismatches between the requirements of project finance and nuclear law. Nuclear law introduces specific requirements affecting the security interest of private lenders, hindering the bankability of nuclear projects on a non-recourse basis. The paper emphasises that the performance-based regulatory approach is more compatible with project finance compared to the prescriptive based one. Furthermore, the paper examines the gaps between nuclear and holistic energy law, looking at the financing of energy infrastructures. Improving nuclear law enables to apply project finance to nuclear power plants, facilitating their deployment. Consequently, nuclear law plays a central role in promoting sustainable energy mixes characterised by reduced carbon emissions.},

These analyses, Koomey and Hultman (2007); Grubler (2010), and Escobar-Rangel and Lévêque (2015), study only 26% of reactors built globally between 1960 and 2010, providing an incomplete picture of the economic evolution of nuclear power construction. This study curates historical reactor-specific overnight construction cost (OCC) data that broaden the scope of study substantially, covering the full cost history for 349 reactors in the US, France, Canada, West Germany, Japan, India, and South Korea, encompassing 58% of all reactors built globally. We find that trends in costs have varied significantly in magnitude and in structure by era, country, and experience. In contrast to the rapid cost escalation that characterized nuclear construction in the United States, we find evidence of much milder cost escalation in many countries, including absolute cost declines in some countries and specific eras. Our new findings suggest that there is no inherent cost escalation trend associated with nuclear technology.},

   abstract = {Load following is the potential for a power plant to adjust its power output as demand and price for electricity fluctuates throughout the day. In nuclear power plants, this is done by inserting control rods into the reactor pressure vessel. This operation is very inefficient as nuclear power generation is composed almost entirely of fixed and sunk costs; therefore, lowering the power output doesn't significantly reduce generating costs and the plant is thermo-mechanical stressed. A more efficient solution is to maintain the primary circuit at full power and to use the excess power for cogeneration. This paper assesses the technical-economic feasibility of this approach when applied to Small Modular Reactors (SMR) with two cogeneration technologies: algae-biofuel and desalinisation. Multiple SMR are of particular interest due to the fractional nature of their power output. The result shows that the power required by an algae-biofuel plant is not sufficient to justify the load following approach, whereas it is in the case of desalination. The successive economic analysis, based on the real options approach, demonstrates the economic viability of the desalination in several scenarios. In conclusion, the coupling of SMR with a desalination plant is a realistic solution to perform efficient load following.},

Secondly, the paper develops a research agenda. Several documents discuss the economics of SMRs, highlighting how the size is not the only factor to consider in the comparison; remarkably, other factors (co-siting economies, modularisation, modularity, construction time, etc.) are relevant. The vast majority of the literature focuses on economic and financial performance indicators (e.g. Levelized Cost of Electricity, Net Present Value, and Internal Rate of Return) and SMR capital cost. Remarkably, very few documents deal with operating and decommissioning costs or take a programme (and its financing) rather than a “single project/plant/site” perspective.

We remembered everyone who has been lost to the pandemic and paid tribute to those still striving to overcome it. Inspired by their example of collaboration and determination, we gathered united by the principle that brought us together originally, that shared beliefs and shared responsibilities are the bedrock of leadership and prosperity. Guided by this, our enduring ideals as free open societies and democracies, and by our commitment to multilateralism, we have agreed a shared G7 agenda for global action to: • End the pandemic and prepare for the future by driving an intensified international effort, starting immediately, to vaccinate the world by getting as many safe vaccines to as many people as possible as fast as possible. Total G7 commitments since the start of the pandemic provide for a total of over two billion vaccine doses, with the commitments since we last met in February 2021, including here in Carbis Bay, providing for one billion doses over the next year. At the same time we will create the appropriate frameworks to strengthen our collective defences against threats to global health by: increasing and coordinating on global manufacturing capacity on all continents; improving early warning systems; and support science in a mission to shorten the cycle for the development of safe and effective vaccines, treatments and tests from 300 to 100 days. • Reinvigorate our economies by advancing recovery plans that build on the $12 trillion of support we have put in place during the pandemic. We will continue to support our economies for as long as is necessary, shifting the focus of our support from crisis response to promoting growth into the future, with plans that create jobs, invest in infrastructure, drive innovation, support people, and level up so that no place or person, irrespective of age, ethnicity or gender is left behind. This has not been the case with past global crises, and we are determined that this time it will be different. • Secure our future prosperity by championing freer, fairer trade within a reformed trading system, a more resilient global economy, and a fairer global tax system that reverses the race to the bottom. We will collaborate to ensure future frontiers of the global economy and society, from cyber space to outer space, increase the prosperity and wellbeing of all people while upholding our values as open societies. We are convinced of the potential of technological transformation for the common good in accordance with our shared values. • Protect our planet by supporting a green revolution that creates jobs, cuts emissions and seeks to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees. We commit to net zero no later than 2050, halving our collective emissions over the two decades to 2030, increasing and improving climate finance to 2025; and to conserve or protect at least 30 percent of our 1 land and oceans by 2030. We acknowledge our duty to safeguard the planet for future generations. • Strengthen our partnerships with others around the world. We will develop a new partnership to build back better for the world, through a step change in our approach to investment for infrastructure, including through an initiative for clean and green growth. We are resolved to deepen our current partnership to a new deal with Africa, including by magnifying support from the International Monetary Fund for countries most in need to support our aim to reach a total global ambition of $100 billion. • Embrace our values as an enduring foundation for success in an ever changing world. We will harness the power of democracy, freedom, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights to answer the biggest questions and overcome the greatest challenges. We will do this in a way that values the individual and promotes equality, especially gender equality, including by supporting a target to get 40 million more girls into education and with at least $2¾ billion for the Global Partnership for Education. We shall seek to advance this open agenda in collaboration with other countries and within the multilateral rules-based system. In particular, we look forward to working alongside our G20 partners and with all relevant International Organisations to secure a cleaner, greener, freer, fairer and safer future for our people and planet. 2},

   abstract = {Energy-technology innovation (ETI) is the set of processes leading to new or improved energy technologies that can augment energy resources; enhance the quality of energy services; and reduce the economic, environmental, or political costs associated with energy supply and use. Advances achieved through ETI have made large contributions to the improvement of the human condition over the past 100 years. Still more will be required of ETI during the decades ahead if civilization is to succeed in meeting what we believe are the three greatest energy challenges still before it: reducing dependence on oil, drastically upgrading the energy services provided to the world's poor, and providing the energy required to increase and sustain prosperity everywhere without wrecking the global climate with the emissions from fossil-fuel burning. This will require significant enhancements to ETI through deeper analysis of ETI processes, greater investments in ETI, improved innovation policies, and better coordination and partnerships across sectors and countries.

   abstract = {The industrial landscape is becoming increasingly complex and dynamic, with innovative technologies stimulating the emergence of new applications, business models and industries. This paper presents a framework for mapping science and technology-based industrial emergence, in order to better understand the nature and characteristics of such phenomena, as a basis for improved strategy development. A full lifecycle perspective is included, emphasizing early stage phases associated with scientific and technological developments, together with key transitions between phases related to the conversion of scientific knowledge to technological capability, application, industrial activity and economic value. Roadmapping concepts are used to map industrial emergence phenomena from various perspectives that cover value creation and capture activities together with demand and supply-side factors. The framework has been tested by developing more than 25 diverse 'emergence maps' of historical industrial evolution, building confidence that the framework might be applicable to current and future emergence. Common characteristics of industrial emergence have been identified, including key events and milestones, focusing on a chain of demonstrators that delineate the various phases and transitions. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Development of new nuclear power facilities faces significant opposition both from knowledgeable individuals who display an understanding of the risks attached to various forms of power generation and those who follow strict politically based ideological dogmas. This article employs data from a 2005 Eurobarometer survey of UK citizens to examine the influence of both political preferences and knowledge in explaining support of nuclear power. Findings reveal that attitudes about nuclear power are highly politically motivated while the influence of knowledge about radioactive waste is dependent upon beliefs about the consequences of nuclear energy use. Perceptions of being informed about radioactive waste and trust in sources providing information about radioactive waste management also predict attitudes toward nuclear power generation.},

   abstract = {Following the development of the New Right Agenda, Conservative Governments in Britain introduced incrementally an extensive privatization programme. This paper focuses on the failure of the last privatization of the Conservatives: British Energy, the company established to run the eight most modern nuclear power stations. A key argument used to justify the privatization of British Energy, the transfer of risk from the state to the private sector, is analyzed using the conceptual framework of the risk society thesis. The privatization led to the apparent transfer to the company of interrelated risks, particularly the nuclear liabilities risk. New Labor's rescue of British Energy confirmed the reality, which was that residual responsibility for risk, especially the nuclear liabilities risk, remained with government. Despite the company's collapse the Labor Government sought a market-based outcome, and in 2008 British Energy was sold to EDF, the French state-owned energy company. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the failure of risk transfer for public policy, drawing on insights provided by the risk society thesis. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Value is traditionally assessed as inputs and outputs. Here, value is conceptualized as a co-created value proposition at the front-end with implications for realization post-completion. Service-dominant logic (SDL) provides the theoretical lens and contributes to a methodological approach for examining projects. Decision-making outcomes provide the evidence from a range of data sources, including reports and commentaries. The methods are interpretative. The findings show that decision-making extends beyond the time-cost-quality/scope dimensions. The long-term issues regarding value realized are often overlooked. Stakeholders and individual actors have mainly focused upon managing political and financial risks, especially time and cost. The research poses challenges to project management analysis, SDL and research design in assessing evidence. Addressing these issues facilitates a knowledge contribution to SDL theorization and the field of project management.},

   abstract = {The last few years have seen some significant changes in the financing of large infrastructure projects, including nuclear power plants. Financial models must take into account factors such as high capital investment, long construction periods, long capital payback periods, problems associated with the fuel cycle, including security of supply, exchange and storage of fuel, non-proliferation. Traditionally, the only entities facing the difficulties and risks mentioned above were large, vertically integrated, state-owned or regulated, sovereign-backed utilities. Also, only they have been able and willing to undertake the financing of investments. The change consists in a greater interest in global capital markets in order to diversify sources of financing and to spread both the costs and the risks among numerous groups of investors. The evolution of the financial models of nuclear power plants in the world takes place based on the following trend: government financing, corporate financing, hybrid financing, project finance. This transformation is moving towards a greater involvement of private capital instead of a reduction of the share in public funds. The article is a detailed discussion of a few modern financial models: Government-to-Government Financing, Loan Guarantees, Host Government-Backed Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), Vendor Financing, and Investor Financing.},

However, a recent trend shows that governments, world-wide, are increasingly looking towards the private sector for new financing approaches with different risk and ownership structures that mitigate target risk mitigation, and new contractual arrangements that aim to lower the fiscal burden associated with nuclear power projects. This paper gives an overview of the major challenges related to financing nuclear power plants such as the high upfront capital cost, sensitivity to interest rate and long construction time. The paper then discuses existing and emerging financing strategies and contractual arrangements for both, government and private investors. The analysis eventually evaluates the potential of the emerging financing approaches to resolve some of the challenges associated with the deployment of nuclear power but there is no one-answer, as each project is unique and requires careful review regarding the applicability of the financing model, as some of these approaches may have their own challenges.},

   abstract = {The benefits of an energy source whose reactants are plentiful and whose products are benign is hard to measure, but at no time in history has this energy source been more needed. Nuclear fusion continues to promise to be this energy source. However, the path to market for fusion systems is still regularly a matter for long-term (20 ? year) plans. This white paper is intended to stimulate discussion of faster commercialization paths, distilling guidance from investors, utilities, and the wider energy research community (including from ARPA-E). There is great interest in a small modular fusion system that can be developed quickly and inexpensively. A simple model shows how compact modular fusion can produce a low cost development path by optimizing traditional systems that burn deuterium and tritium, operating not only at high magnetic field strength, but also by omitting some components that allow for the core to become more compact and easier to maintain. The dominant hurdles to the development of low cost, practical fusion systems are discussed, primarily in terms of the constraints placed on the cost of development stages in the private sector. The main finding presented here is that the bridge from DOE Office of Science to the energy market can come at the Proof of Principle development stage, providing the concept is sufficiently compact and inexpensive that its development allows for a normal technology commercialization path. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

   abstract = {Obtaining a burning plasma is a critical step towards self-sustaining fusion energy1. A burning plasma is one in which the fusion reactions themselves are the primary source of heating in the plasma, which is necessary to sustain and propagate the burn, enabling high energy gain. After decades of fusion research, here we achieve a burning-plasma state in the laboratory. These experiments were conducted at the US National Ignition Facility, a laser facility delivering up to 1.9 megajoules of energy in pulses with peak powers up to 500 terawatts. We use the lasers to generate X-rays in a radiation cavity to indirectly drive a fuel-containing capsule via the X-ray ablation pressure, which results in the implosion process compressing and heating the fuel via mechanical work. The burning-plasma state was created using a strategy to increase the spatial scale of the capsule2,3 through two different implosion concepts4–7. These experiments show fusion self-heating in excess of the mechanical work injected into the implosions, satisfying several burning-plasma metrics3,8. Additionally, we describe a subset of experiments that appear to have crossed the static self-heating boundary, where fusion heating surpasses the energy losses from radiation and conduction. These results provide an opportunity to study α-particle-dominated plasmas and burning-plasma physics in the laboratory.},

Abstract The high beta tokamak-extended pulse (HBT-EP) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) mode control research program is studying ITER relevant internal modular feedback control coil configurations and their impact on kink mode rigidity, advanced digital control algorithms and the effects of plasma rotation and three-dimensional magnetic fields on MHD mode stability. A new segmented adjustable conducting wall has been installed on the HBT-EP and is made up of 20 independent, movable, wall shell segments instrumented with three distinct sets of 40 saddle coils, totaling 120 in-vessel modular feedback control coils. Each internal coil set has been designed with varying toroidal angular coil coverage of 5, 10 and 15 • , spanning the toroidal angle range of an ITER port plug based internal coil to test resistive wall mode (RWM) interaction and multimode MHD plasma response to such highly localized control fields. In addition, we have implemented 336 new poloidal and radial magnetic sensors to quantify the applied three-dimensional fields of our control coils along with the observed plasma response. This paper describes the design and implementation of the new control shell incorporating these control and sensor coils on the HBT-EP, and the research program plan on the upgraded HBT-EP to understand how best to optimize the use of modular feedback coils to control instability growth near the ideal wall stabilization limit, answer critical questions about the role of plasma rotation in active control of the RWM and the ferritic resistive wall mode, and to improve the performance of MHD control systems used in fusion experiments and future burning plasma systems.},

   abstract = {This book is dedicated to the field of inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC) fusion. Confinement of a hot plasma for fusion or plasma processing is difficult because the hot plasma prevents use of a material confinement vessel. IEC fusion is one of the various methods that can be used to confine a hot fusion plasma. As will be apparent from this book, IEC fusion offers many potential advantages, including simplified support structures and the ability to create non-Maxwellian plasmas that can be used with a variety of fusion fuels. However, a majority of fusion scientists are studying magnetic field confinement in the form of a closed torus (e.g., a Tokamak). Alternately, the fast pulsed approach used in laser fusion attempts to rapidly compress the plasma to an ultrahigh density, and the inertia of the ions maintains the high density long enough such that the fusion energy produced exceeds the input compression energy. Thus, this approach was termed inertial confinement fusion (ICF). These two approaches have led to current major fusion experiments: the international ITER Tokamak in France and the National Ignition Fusion (NIF) experiment using a laser at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Both confinement approaches require very large and complex units, costing billions of dollars to construct. A number of alternate confinement concepts have been proposed with the objective of achieving smaller, less expensive power plants. Some also have the objective of burning “advanced fuels,” defined loosely as any non-D–T fuels [1]. Examples include deuterium–deuterium (D–D), deuterium–helium-3 (D–3He), and hyrdrogen–boron-11 (H–B11). One objective of using such fuels is to minimize neutron production, thus neutron-induced radioactivity and damage in structural materials. A second objective is to reduce or eliminate the need for tritium handling and breeding, greatly simplifying the chamber blanket systems. Hydrogen–boron-11 (or H–B11, often termed p–B11) is ideal with a plentiful fuel supply and a reaction that produces three energetic alpha particles with no neutron (hence aneutronic). However, burning p–B11 generally requires very high ion temperatures (~ 170 keV vs. ~ 25 keV for D–T) and low electron temperatures (< 1/5 the ion temperature), plus elimination of magnetic fields within the hot fusing plasma to minimize Bremsstrahlung and cyclotron radiation losses, respectively. The IEC is one of only a few alternate confinement approaches that theoretically offer the highly non-Maxwellian plasma conditions needed to burn p–B11. Experimental demonstration of this is a key objective for IEC experiments but is very challenging, as discussed in later chapters.},

   abstract = {With good confinement and relatively high beta (up to 40%), the spherical tokamak could be a suitable magnetized target. To illustrate this potential, the theoretical fusion yield from compressing a spherical tokamak adiabatically to fusion conditions is calculated. While it is found that the large amount of energy stored in the compressed toroidal field constrains the potential energy gain, a system can be designed to produce significant useful output by directly recovering a large fraction of the compression energy. With 80% energy recovery, an example system using 140 MJ of pressurized gas to compress the spherical tokamak plasma within a 2 m radius liquid metal flux conserver can produce a fusion yield of 140 MJ and a net output of 40 MJ per pulse. At * 1 Hz this would produce 40 MW electric. Keywords Spherical tokamak Á Magnetized target fusion Á Magneto-inertial fusion Á General fusion General Fusion is developing Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF) based in part on the LINUS concept [1, 2]. In MTF a magnetized plasma target formed into a liquid metal flux conserver (liner) is rapidly compressed to fusion conditions (s compression \ s E). At peak compression a fast burst of fusion is created. The formation-compression cycle is repeated at * 1 Hz. In this paper we will investigate the compression of a spherical tokamak (ST) and its suitability for MTF power generation. Spherical tokamaks are known to have much better confinement than spheromaks, FRC, RFP, etc. Tor-oidal Beta (b) up to 40% has been achieved in ST [3]. They could therefore be a good plasma target for MTF, as proposed in the past [4]. Such a system would look something like this. The initial toroidal field is created by running current in the liquid metal center shaft, through the top and bottom metallic black cones and returning it in the liquid flux conserver, as shown in Fig. 1a arrows. It is, in effect, a one turn toroidal field coil driven by the capacitor bank. There is no center solenoid to drive plasma current as is common in most tokamaks. Instead, the plasma is formed 100% by Coaxial Helicity Injection (CHI) [5]. For each pulse of the system, operation proceeds as follows. The capacitors shown in the picture are fired. With no plasma yet present, current starts to circulate around the liquid flux conserver and the liquid shaft, generating an initial vacuum toroidal field. Then, the gas injected into the stuffing flux is ionized. Further increase in current flows along the poloidal field lines and the increasing toroidal field in the plasma injector pushes the stuffing flux into the cavity (Fig. 1b). Reconnection occurs and the closed magnetic flux surfaces of the ST are formed (Fig. 1c). As the electrodes of this plasma formation system must last millions of shots, erosion could be a problem. Estimates based on the maximum electrode metal impurity acceptable in the plasma limit the erosion rate to an acceptable 100 lm/year. Poloidal coils are not required; the liquid flux conserver will maintain the equilibrium during the fast plasma generation and compression time. This means that the formation and compression must be faster than the flux diffusion time in the liquid metal. The magnetic diffusion depth in PbLi for the compression time (* 50 ms) is 16 cm \ \ 2 m (the radius of the initial plasma). The ST is rapidly formed by CHI and is compressed while ohmicaly decaying. No attempts are made to maintain the plasma current in the ST after its formation. For self-similar compression, the shaft diameter must also decrease. This can be achieved by having the magnetic pressure pinch the shaft to smaller diameter. It is also possible to use not exactly self-similar compression. The liquid shaft can be a liquid tube where the wall thickness(0123456789().,-volV) (0123456789().,-volV)},

However, surprisingly little investigation has been conducted of the filing of patents in the nuclear fusion industry in recent years, and even less of the patent filing activity of nuclear fusion's private sector. We analyse the patents filed by members of the US-based Fusion Industry Association (FIA), by company, year, and patent classification codes, in a way that will be of interest to academics, fusion companies and the overall fusion industry, public sector policy makers, and political decision makers. We find that the FIA now represents a considerable and varied body of intellectual property, with some FIA members beginning to demonstrate extensive patenting, especially in the case of spherical tokamak technology, including with patents for shielding materials and the tritium fuel cycle. These findings adds weight to the notion of a public-private partnership and cost-sharing approach to Fusion Pilot Plants, presently being advocated by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the US Department of Energy, and the FIA itself.},

   abstract = {The breeding blanket with integrated first wall (FW) is the key nuclear component for power extraction, tritium fuel sustainability, and radiation shielding in fusion reactors. The ITER device will address plasma burn physics and plasma support technology, but it does not have a breeding blanket. Current activities to develop "roadmaps" for realizing fusion power recognize the blanket/FW as one of the principal remaining challenges. Therefore, a central element of the current planning activities is focused on the question: what are the research and major facilities required to develop the blanket/FW to a level which enables the design, construction and successful operation of a fusion DEMO? The principal challenges in the development of the blanket/FW are: (1) the Fusion Nuclear Environment - a multiple-field environment (neutrons, heat/particle fluxes, magnetic field, etc.) with high magnitudes and steep gradients and transients; (2) Nuclear Heating in a large volume with sharp gradients - the nuclear heating drives most blanket phenomena, but accurate simulation of this nuclear heating can be done only in a DT-plasma based facility; and (3) Complex Configuration with blanket/first wall/divertor inside the vacuum vessel - the consequence is low fault tolerance and long repair/replacement time. These blanket/FW development challenges result in critical consequences: (a) non-fusion facilities (laboratory experiments) need to be substantial to simulate multiple fields/multiple effects and must be accompanied by extensive modeling; (b) results from non-fusion facilities will be limited and will not fully resolve key technical issues. A DT-plasma based fusion nuclear science facility (FNSF) is required to perform "multiple effects" and "integrated" experiments in the fusion nuclear environment; and (c) the Reliability/Availability/Maintainability/Inspectability (RAMI) of fusion nuclear components is a major challenge and is one of the primary reasons why the blanket/FW will pace fusion development toward a DEMO. This paper summarizes the top technical issues and elucidates the primary challenges in developing the blanket/first wall and identifies the key R&D needs in non-fusion and fusion facilities on the path to DEMO.},

   abstract = {Abstract A promising way to use heat from carbon-free sources such as concentrated solar or nuclear is to drive chemical reactions for the production of fuels for the transport sector. Recent developments offer attractive medium- to long-term prospects for the provision of hydrogen and synthetic fuels. It is possible to use solar heat directly to split \{H2O\} into \{H2\} and \{O2\} or \{CO2\} into \{CO\} and O2. However, these single-step processes require operating temperatures above 2000 °C, which places high demands on materials and process conditions. To reduce these extremely high operating temperatures and eliminate the need for high-temperature gas separation, current research activities focus on alternative thermochemical cycles. The most prominent examples are cycles from the sulfur family, the hybrid sulfur and sulfur–iodine process, cycles applying metal–metal oxide pairs or multivalent metal oxides, and low-temperature cycles such as hybrid Cu-Cl. The current analysis gives an overview on recent developments and the state-of-the-art of those cycles. It looks at the most important performance parameters involved and provides an outlook on further potential and necessary developments. },

   abstract = {The scenario in a risk analysis can be defined as the propagating feature of specific initiating event which can go to a wide range of undesirable consequences. If we take various scenarios into consideration, the risk analysis becomes more complex than do without them. A lot of risk analyses have been performed to actually estimate a risk profile under both uncertain future states of hazard sources and undesirable scenarios. Unfortunately, in case of considering specific systems such as a radioactive waste disposal facility, since the behaviour of future scenarios is hardly predicted without special reasoning process, we cannot estimate their risk only with a traditional risk analysis methodology. Moreover, we believe that the sources of uncertainty at future states can be reduced pertinently by setting up dependency relationships interrelating geological, hydrological, and ecological aspects of the site with all the scenarios. It is then required current methodology of uncertainty analysis of the waste disposal facility be revisited under this belief. In order to consider the effects predicting from an evolution of environmental conditions of waste disposal facilities, this paper proposes a quantitative assessment framework integrating the inference process of Bayesian network to the traditional probabilistic risk analysis. We developed and verified an approximate probabilistic inference program for the specific Bayesian network using a bounded-variance likelihood weighting algorithm. Ultimately, specific models, including a model for uncertainty propagation of relevant parameters were developed with a comparison of variable-specific effects due to the occurrence of diverse altered evolution scenarios (AESs). After providing supporting information to get a variety of quantitative expectations about the dependency relationship between domain variables and AESs, we could connect the results of probabilistic inference from the Bayesian network with the consequence evaluation model addressed. We got a number of practical results to improve current knowledge base for the prioritization of future risk-dominant variables in an actual site.},

   abstract = {Many high-hazard industries around the world have explicitly recognized the critical role that human, management and organizational risk factors play in major accidents. The findings of accident investigations and risk assessments demonstrate a growing recognition that the cultural context of work practices may influence safety just as much as technology. The objective of this paper is to establish a relationship between the concepts of safety culture and organizational culture in a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). This study permits the identification and quantification of the possible mechanisms for improving the safety culture in the NPP acting on organizational culture. It therefore provides a methodology to identify potential strategies for safety improvement. Probabilistic (Bayesian) Networks (BNs) have been used to determine the relationships between the organizational culture and safety culture in a quantitative form. To this aim, we considered data from a survey conducted of every employee at a Spanish NPP. The resulting data-driven models allow us to establish the probabilistic relationship among organizational culture factors, including the 12 OCI (Organizational Culture Inventory) scales, that have an influence on safety culture. The study yielded a ranking of organizational cultures that can be used to improve safety culture in a NPP.},

   abstract = {With increased adoption of digital systems for instrumentation and control, nuclear power plants have become more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Such attacks can have very serious implications on a plant's operation, especially if they masquerade as safety events. Thus, it is important that research be focused towards distinguishing cyber-attacks from fault induced safety events for a correct response in a timely manner. In this paper, an event classifier is presented to classify abnormal events in nuclear power plants as either fault induced safety events or cyber-attacks. The process of inferring the hidden (unobservable) state of a system (normal or faulty) through observable physical sensor measurements has been a long-standing industry practice. There has been a recent surge of literature discussing the use of network traffic data for the detection of cyber-attacks on industrial control systems. In the classifier we present, both physical and network behaviors of a nuclear power plant during abnormal events (safety events or cyber-attacks) are used to infer the probabilities of the states of the plant. The nature of the abnormal event in question is then determined based on these probabilities. The Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) methodology is used for this purpose since it is an appropriate framework for inferring hidden states of a system from observed variables through probabilistic reasoning. In this paper we introduce a DBN based abnormal event classifier and an architecture to implement this classifier as part of a monitoring system. An experimental environment is setup with a two-tank system in conjunction with a nuclear power plant simulator and a programmable logic controller. A set of 27 cyber-attacks and 14 safety events were systematically designed for the experiment. A set of 6 cyber-attacks and 2 safety events were used to manually finetune the Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) of the 2-timeslice dynamic Bayesian network (2T-DBN). Out of the remaining 33 events, the nature of the abnormal event was successfully identified in all the 33 cases and the location of the cyber-attack or fault was successfully determined in 32 cases. The case-study demonstrates the applicability of the methodology developed. Further research should examine the practicality of implementing the proposed monitoring system on a real-world system and issues associated with cost optimization.},

   abstract = {To efficiently utilize the solar energy and maintain the system reliability, accurate forecasting of the power production by photovoltaic (PV) systems is required. The traditional deterministic forecasting approach predicts a single value of the PV power production without taking into account the uncertainty of the prediction. As a result, it provides less accurate forecast compared with the probabilistic forecasting approach. The latter approach gives a complete outlook of all the possible outputs and their corresponding probabilistic confidence levels. This paper proposes a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) theory based conditional probabilistic forecasting algorithm to predict the regional PV power production. The proposed forecasting method provides the probability density function of the future PV power production. It could greatly help system operator to make decisions on the generation scheduling and dispatch by reducing the uncertainty of the regional solar generation output. Moreover, the performance of the proposed method is further improved by selecting the meteorological variables presenting the highest influence on the PV power production level. Simulations are performed on a realistic photovoltaic system. Results show that the proposed forecasting model is effective and promising on short-term PV power production forecasting. © 2014 Chin.

   abstract = {Uncertainty of cost items is an important aspect of complex projects. Cost uncertainty analysis aims to help decision makers to understand and model different factors affecting funding exposure and ultimately estimate the cost of project. The common practice in cost uncertainty analysis includes breaking the project into cost items and probabilistically capturing the uncertainty of each item. Dependencies between these items are important and if not considered properly may influence the accuracy of cost estimation. However these dependencies are seldom examined and there are theoretical and practical obstacles in modeling them. This paper proposes a quantitative assessment framework integrating the inference process of Bayesian networks (BN) to the traditional probabilistic risk analysis. BNs provide a framework for presenting causal relationships and enable probabilistic inference among a set of variables. The new approach explicitly quantifies uncertainty in project cost and also provides an appropriate method for modeling complex relationships in a project, such as common causal factors, formal use of experts' judgments, and learning from data to update previous beliefs and probabilities. The capabilities of the proposed approach are explained by a simple example. © 2014 IPMA and Elsevier Ltd.},

The framework uses hybrid and dynamic BNs containing both discrete and continuous variables over multiple time stages. The BN framework calculates costs and benefits based on multiple causal factors including the effects of individual risk factors, budget deficits, and time value discounting, taking account of the parameter uncertainty of all continuous variables. The framework can serve as the basis for various project management assessments and is illustrated using a case study of an agricultural development project.},

In this research, a methodology is proposed to quantify model uncertainty using measured differences between experimental data and model outcomes under a Bayesian statistical framework.

Since Bayesian network is specialized in dealing with uncertainties, those risk factors are then modeled into a Bayesian network to facilitate the assessing of the risk involved in an NPD process.

The spherical torus/tokamak (ST) is a leading candidate for an FNSF due to its potentially high neutron wall loading and modular configuration. A key consideration for the choice of FNSF configuration is the range of achievable missions as a function of device size. Possible missions include: providing high neutron wall loading and fluence, demonstrating tritium self-sufficiency, and demonstrating electrical self-sufficiency. All of these missions must also be compatible with a viable divertor, first-wall, and blanket solution. ST-FNSF configurations have been developed simultaneously incorporating for the first time: (1) a blanket system capable of tritium breeding ratio TBR  ≈  1, (2) a poloidal field coil set supporting high elongation and triangularity for a range of internal inductance and normalized beta values consistent with NSTX/NSTX-U previous/planned operation, (3) a long-legged divertor analogous to the MAST-U divertor which substantially reduces projected peak divertor heat-flux and has all outboard poloidal field coils outside the vacuum chamber and superconducting to reduce power consumption, and (4) a vertical maintenance scheme in which blanket structures and the centerstack can be removed independently. Progress in these ST-FNSF missions versus configuration studies including dependence on plasma major radius <italic>R</italic> <sub>0</sub> for a range 1 m–2.2 m are described.

This can be studied using systems codes, which allow for the rapid conceptual study of power plants covering everything, from the plasma through to electricity generation. In this paper, we describe models in the systems code PROCESS that have been added specifically for spherical tokamaks. Within PROCESS an alternative relation for the plasma current is included which accounts for the increased ratio of Ip/aB. We have tested this against a series of equilibria created with the free boundary equilibrium code FIESTA, and additionally performed our own fit. We also outline the engineering changes that can be made to the device and describe a water-cooled copper centrepost model. To test our models we recreate the published designs for the Fusion Nuclear Science Facility (FNSF) and a High Temperature Superconducting Pilot Plant (HTS-PP) and find good agreement. We conclude by highlighting the efficiencies needed to produce net electricity from small fusion devices.},

   abstract = {When designing a new large experimental device, extrapolation from current knowledge and scaling laws into unexplored design space is unavoidable, and predicting the behaviour of a new device is therefore subject to significant uncertainties. This makes it difficult to determine an optimal design. For conceptual fusion power plants, a further concern is whether the expected performance will yield any net electricity and for pulsed power plants a reasonable pulse length. In this work, we focus on evaluating the effects of selected uncertainties regarding the general plasma physics performance in the current European pulsed DEMO design (nominally 500 MW net electrical power, 2 h pulse length). This is meant as a first step towards uncertainty quantification for DEMO. We use a Monte-Carlo method in combination with the systems modelling code PROCESS to map out the probable machine performance. The results show that assuming only these specific uncertainties it is a reasonable assumption that the current design is capable of providing 400 MW of net electricity while maintaining a pulse length of 1 h or more.},

   abstract = {This paper deals with computations of sensitivity indices in sensitivity analysis. Given a mathematical or computational model y = f(x1,x2,...,xk), where the input factors xi's are uncorrelated with one another, one can see y as the realization of a stochastic process obtained by sampling each of the xi from its marginal distribution. The sensitivity indices are related to the decomposition of the variance of y into terms either due to each xi taken singularly (first order indices), as well as into terms due to the cooperative effects of more than one xi. In this paper we assume that one has computed the full set of first order sensitivity indices as well as the full set of total-order sensitivity indices (a fairly common strategy in sensitivity analysis), and show that in this case the same set of model evaluations can be used to compute double estimates of: the total effect of two factors taken together, for all such (2k) couples, where k is the dimensionality of the model; the total effect of k-2 factors taken together, for all (2k) such (k-2) ples. We further introduce a new strategy for the computation of the full sets of first plus total order sensitivity indices that is about 50% cheaper in terms of model evaluations with respect to previously published works. We discuss separately the case where the input factors xi's are not independent from each other. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, few if any studies have explored how values of k (number of subsets) affect validation results in models tested with data of known statistical properties. Here, we explore conditions of sample size, model structure, and variable dependence affecting validation outcomes in discrete Bayesian networks (BNs). We created 6 variants of a BN model with known properties of variance and collinearity, along with data sets of n = 50, 500, and 5000 samples, and then tested classification success and evaluated CPU computation time with seven levels of folds (k = 2, 5, 10, 20, n − 5, n − 2, and n − 1). Classification error declined with increasing n, particularly in BN models with high multivariate dependence, and declined with increasing k, generally levelling out at k = 10, although k = 5 sufficed with large samples (n = 5000). Our work supports the common use of k = 10 in the literature, although in some cases k = 5 would suffice with BN models having independent variable structures.},

The thermal energy confinement time ( <italic>τ</italic> <sub>Ε</sub> ) also typically has a stronger dependence on toroidal magnetic field and a weaker dependence on plasma current, but so far it has not been established how this difference impacts performance under reactor conditions. This aspect is explored in this paper.

   abstract = {<p> The energy confinement time of tokamak plasmas scales positively with plasma size and so it is generally expected that the fusion triple product, <italic>nTτ</italic> <sub>E</sub> , will also increase with size, and this has been part of the motivation for building devices of increasing size including ITER. Here <italic>n</italic> , <italic>T</italic> , and <italic>τ</italic> <sub>E</sub> are the ion density, ion temperature and energy confinement time respectively. However, tokamak plasmas are subject to operational limits and two important limits are a density limit and a beta limit. We show that when these limits are taken into account, <italic>nTτ</italic> <sub>E</sub> becomes almost independent of size; rather it depends mainly on the fusion power, <italic>P</italic> <sub>fus</sub> . In consequence, the fusion power gain, <italic>Q</italic> <sub>fus</sub> , a parameter closely linked to <italic>nTτ</italic> <sub>E</sub> is also independent of size. Hence, <italic>P</italic> <sub>fus</sub> and <italic>Q</italic> <sub>fus</sub> , two parameters of critical importance in reactor design, are actually tightly coupled. Further, we find that <italic>nTτ</italic> <sub>E</sub> is inversely dependent on the normalised beta, <italic>β</italic> <sub>N</sub> ; an unexpected result that tends to favour lower power reactors. Our findings imply that the minimum power to achieve fusion reactor conditions is driven mainly by physics considerations, especially energy confinement, while the minimum device size is driven by technology and engineering considerations. Through dedicated R&amp;D and parallel developments in other fields, the technology and engineering aspects are evolving in a direction to make smaller devices feasible. </p>},

   abstract = {A simplified physics, engineering, and costing model of a tokamak fusion reactor is used to examine quantitatively the connection between physics performance and power-plant economics. The material contained herein was generated as part of a broader study of the economic, safety, and environmental impact of fusion based on a range of confinement schemes, fusion fuels, blanket/shield configurations, power-conversion schemes, and commercial end products. Only a DT-fuelled tokamak reactor that produces electricity through an intermediate heat exchange and a conventional thermal-electric conversion cycle is considered; a self-cooled lithium-metal blanket with vanadium-alloy structure, steel shield, and superconducting magnets is used for all cases studied. An optimistic extension of Troyon scaling is applied to a high-elongation (κ = 2.5) and low-safety-factor (qψ=2.3) plasma with β=0.1 and efficient (IφPCD=0.2 A/W) current drive. This 1200-MWe (net) power plant provides an economically competitive base case with which to compare other approaches to tokamak fusion power. The base case chosen for comparisons represents an optimistic extrapolation of present tokamak physics and technology. Troyon scaling with a coefficientβBφa/Iφequal to 0.04 is applied; the impact of an ad hoc but pessimistic scaling that diminished the Troyon coefficient with plasma elongation was also examined. Additionally, a constant current-drive efficiency, ϒ=nIφRT/PCD=0.2 A/W, atT=10 keV plasma temperature is assumed; although representing an aggressive R&D target relative to present experience, the realization of bootstrap currents for the basecase, and especially for the second-stability-region tokamak, can significantly reduce this problem. The impact and reoptimization for a constant normalized current-drive efficiency, ϒ=nIφRT/PCD, was also examined. Although the focus of this study has been the optimistic basecase tokamak, comparisons are made with tokamaks based on (a) operation in the second-stability region (β=0.2, increased aspect ratio, reduced elongation), (b) super high-field but low-beta operation, (c) very low aspect ratio and highly elongated spherical torus, and (d) a direct application of the present database using a long-pulsed, low-beta tokamak. The economic impact of a range of base-case parameters and operating variables is examined, including current-drive efficiency, beta, stability limits, advanced magnets, economy of scale, blanket/shield lifetime, blanket thickness, and plant lead time. It is found that a range of tokamak options, relative to the optimistic base case selected for this study, may provide economically competitive power plants. Areas where physics and technology advances are needed to achieve this attractive end product are quantitively elucidated for all tokamak options considered.},

While many governments and private companies are putting significant resources on the development of hydrogen technologies, there still remains a high number of unsolved issues, including technical challenges, economic and geopolitical implications. The hydrogen supply chain includes a large number of steps, resulting in additional energy losses, and while much focus is put on hydrogen generation costs, its transport and storage should not be neglected. A low-carbon hydrogen economy offers promising opportunities not only to fight climate change, but also to enhance energy security and develop local industries in many countries. However, to face the huge challenges of a transition towards a zero-carbon energy system, all available technologies should be allowed to contribute based on measurable indicators, which require a strong international consensus based on transparent standards and targets.</p>},

   abstract = {Inference is one key objective in a Bayesian network (BN), and it aims to estimate the posterior distributions of state variables based on evidence (observations). While efficient analytical inference algorithms (either approximate or exact) for BN with discrete variables have been well-established in the literature, the inference in BN with continuous variables is still challenging if the BN is non-linear and/or non-Gaussian. In this case we can either discretize the continuous variable and utilize the inference approaches for discrete BN; or we have to use sampling-based methods such as MCMC for static BN and particle filter for dynamic BN. This paper proposes a network collapsing technique based on the concept of probability integral transform to convert a multi-layer BN to an equivalent simple two-layer BN, so that the unscented Kalman filter can be applied to the collapsed BN and the posterior distributions of state variables can be obtained analytically. For dynamic BN, the proposed method is also able to propagate the state variables to the next time step analytically using the unscented transform, based on the assumption that the posterior distributions of state variables are Gaussian. Thus the proposed method achieves a very fast approximate solution, making it particularly suitable for dynamic BN where inference and uncertainty propagation are required over many time steps.},

   abstract = {In a power plant scale fusion reactor, a huge amount of thermal power produced by the fusion reaction and external heating must be exhausted through the narrow area of the divertor targets. The targets must withstand the intense bombardment of the diverted particles where high heat fluxes are generated and erosion takes place on the surface. A considerable amount of volumetric nuclear heating power must also be exhausted. To cope with such an unprecedented power exhaust challenge, a highly efficient cooling capacity is required. Furthermore, the divertor must fulfill other critical functions such as nuclear shielding and channeling (and compression) of exhaust gas for pumping. Assuring the structural integrity of the neutron-irradiated (thus embrittled) components is a crucial prerequisite for a reliable operation over the lifetime. Safety, maintainability, availability, waste and costs are another points of consideration. In late 2020, the Pre-Conceptual Design activities to develop the divertor of the European demonstration fusion reactor were officially concluded. On this occasion, the baseline design and the key technology options were identified and verified by the project team (EUROfusion Work Package Divertor) based on seven years of R&D efforts and endorsed by Gate Review Panel. In this paper, an overview of the load specifications, brief descriptions of the design and the highlights of the technology R&D work are presented together with the further work still needed.},

   abstract = {Coastal communities are threatened by the impact of severe storms that may cause significant loss or damage of property and life. The main processes causing such impacts at sandy coastlines and nearby coastal communities are storm erosion, overwash and inundation. Coastal response under present conditions and under predicted climate change has been frequently assessed on the basis of numerical models, which in turn can be also used to evaluate the effectiveness of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) measures to mitigate the response of the coast to the imposed conditions. However, detailed morphodynamic models are computationally expensive and not commonly used by coastal managers. The present work proposes the construction of a probabilistic Bayesian Network (BN) as a surrogate for the numerical simulations. This BN is trained with a large number of morphodynamic simulations, under a variety of storm conditions and DRR measures, in order to serve as a front-end platform for visualising, analysing and evaluating combined results of the numerical modelling. The BN introduced in an early warning system will be able to serve both, as a predictive and as a working tool to determine impacts and evaluate risk reduction after measures implementation. Here, an example of the implementation and results of such a BN system is presented. The BN system was built for a coastal sector of the Ria Formosa barrier island system (South Portugal) to inform the degree of impact derived from overwash and erosion over the study area. The BN boundary conditions include variable wave height, water level, and wave period. The impact on receptors, including houses and infrastructure, was assessed. In addition, this tool can inform about the effectiveness of a particular DRR measure. The evaluated DRR measures were two primary measures (partial house removal and beach replenishment) and a non-primary measure (improve channels of communication), all measures proposed by local stakeholders. Results show that for a storm with wave characteristics of the 1 in 50 year return period and spring tide conditions, the house removal DRR reduces the overwash impact by 15% and erosion impact by 58%. The implementation of beach replenishment could reduce the erosion impact of the same event by 96% while it would have a smaller effect on the overwash impact (16%). The implementation of non-primary measures would have a much smaller effect on risk reduction. The combined effect of the above DRR measures (mainly house removal and beach nourishment) reduces storm impacts at the study area to a value near zero. The BN surrogates the model simulated onshore hazards and translates them into impacts for the current conditions, which give a high degree of confidence in the potential application of the BN as a management tool.},

   abstract = {Low frequency, high impact storm events can have large impacts on sandy coasts. The physical processes governing these impacts are complex because of the feedback between the hydrodynamics of surges and waves, sediment transport and morphological change. Predicting these coastal changes using a numerical model requires a large amount of computational time, which in the case of an operational prediction for the purpose of Early Warning is not available. For this reason morphodynamic predictions are not commonly included in Early Warning Systems (EWSs). However, omitting these physical processes in an EWS may lead to potential under or over estimation of the impact of a storm event. To solve this problem, a method has been developed to construct a probabilistic Bayesian Network (BN). This BN connects three elements: offshore hydraulic boundary conditions, characteristics of the coastal zone, and onshore hazards, such as erosion and overwash depths and velocities. The hydraulic boundary conditions are derived at a water depth of approximately 20m from a statistical analysis of observed data using copulas, and site characteristics are obtained from measurements. This BN is trained using output data from many pre-computed process-based model simulations, which connect the three elements. Once trained, the response of the BN is instantaneous and can be used as a surrogate for a process-based model in an EWS in which the BN can be updated with an observation of the hydraulic boundary conditions to give a prediction for onshore hazards. The method was applied to Praia de Faro, Portugal, a low-lying urbanised barrier island, which is subject to frequent flooding. Using a copula-based statistical analysis, which preserves the natural variability of the observations, a synthetic dataset containing 100 events was created, based on 20years of observations, but extended to return periods of significant wave height of up to 50years. These events were transformed from offshore to onshore using a 2D XBeach (Roelvink et al., 2009) model. Three BN configurations were constructed, of which the best performing one was able to predict onshore hazards as computed by the model with an accuracy ranging from 81% to 88% and predict events with no significant onshore hazards with an accuracy ranging from 90% to 95%. Two examples are presented on the use of a BN in operational predictions or as an analysis tool. The added value of this method is that it can be applied to many coastal sites: (1) limited observations of offshore hydrodynamic parameters can be extended using the copula method which retains the original observations' natural variability, (2) the transformation from offshore observations to onshore hazards can be computed with any preferred coastal model and (3) a BN can be adjusted to fit any relevant connections between offshore hydraulic boundary conditions and onshore hazards. Furthermore, a BN can be continuously updated with new information and expanded to include different morphological conditions or risk reduction measures. As such, it is a promising extension of existing EWSs and as a planning tool for coastal managers.},

The plasma current reaches I p &gt; 80 kA for high density (&gt;5 × 1018 m−2) discharge with 150 kW ECRH. An analysis was carried out combining reconstructed multi-fluid equilibrium, guiding-center orbits of energetic electrons, and resonant heating mechanisms.

   abstract = {This paper analyses the potential of renewable fuels in different propulsion systems for the maritime sector that can replace fossil fuels by 2030. First, a fuel cost analysis is performed for a range of biofuels, bio-electrofuels, electrofuels plus liquid hydrogen and electricity in 18 fuel production pathways. Next, fuel production costs are combined with different utilisation rates, propulsion cost, on-board fuel storage cost and a cost for reduced cargo space to determine the total cost of ownership for four types of ships: large ferries, general cargo, bulk carriers and container vessels using internal combustion engines, fuel cells or battery-electric propulsion systems and travelling different distances. In large ferries, the battery-electric propulsion is found at a lower cost than all fuel options except biofuels. For the other ship types, cheaper fuels (as biofuels) benefit internal combustion engines, while expensive fuels (as electrofuels) increase the competitiveness of fuel cells due to their higher efficiency. Similarly, low utilisation rates benefit internal combustion engines, while higher utilisation rates tend to support fuel cells. General cargo vessels have a similar total cost of ownership for both four-stroke internal combustion engines and fuel cells. Bulk carriers and container ships use two-stroke engines, with efficiencies closer to fuel cells, but the lowest-cost solution remains internal combustion engines, except when increasing the efficiency or reducing the investment cost of fuel cells. In almost all fuel-propulsion combinations, methanol is the lowest-cost fuel, but dimethyl ether and ammonia show only marginally higher costs.},

Here we extend previous studies [R. Maingi et al., J. Nucl. Mater. 363-365 (2007) 196-200] to higher triangularity ∼0.7 and higher Ip ≤ 1.2 MA. First we note that the mid-plane heat flux width mapped to the mid-plane, λqmid, is largely independent of PLOSS for PLOSS ≥ 4 MW. λqmid is also found to be relatively independent of fexp; peak heat flux is strongly reduced as fexp is increased, as expected. Finally, λqmid is shown to strongly contract with increasing Ip such that λqmid∝Ip-1.6 with a peak divertor heat flux of q div, peak ∼ 15 MW/m2 when Ip = 1.2 MA and PLOSS ∼ 6 MW.

@article{Abdou2021,
   abstract = {<p> The tritium aspects of the DT fuel cycle embody some of the most challenging feasibility and attractiveness issues in the development of fusion systems. The review and analyses in this paper provide important information to understand and quantify these challenges and to define the phase space of plasma physics and fusion technology parameters and features that must guide a serious R&amp;D in the world fusion program. We focus in particular on components, issues and R&amp;D necessary to satisfy three ‘principal requirements’: (1) achieving tritium self-sufficiency within the fusion system, (2) providing a tritium inventory for the initial start-up of a fusion facility, and (3) managing the safety and biological hazards of tritium. A primary conclusion is that the physics and technology state-of-the-art will not enable DEMO and future power plants to satisfy these principal requirements. We quantify goals and define specific areas and ideas for physics and technology R&amp;D to meet these requirements. A powerful fuel cycle dynamics model was developed to calculate time-dependent tritium inventories and flow rates in all parts and components of the fuel cycle for different ranges of parameters and physics and technology conditions. Dynamics modeling analyses show that the key parameters affecting tritium inventories, tritium start-up inventory, and tritium self-sufficiency are the tritium burn fraction in the plasma ( <italic>f</italic> <sub>b</sub> ), fueling efficiency ( <italic>η</italic> <sub>f</sub> ), processing time of plasma exhaust in the inner fuel cycle ( <italic>t</italic> <sub>p</sub> ), reactor availability factor (AF), reserve time ( <italic>t</italic> <sub>r</sub> ) which determines the reserve tritium inventory needed in the storage system in order to keep the plant operational for time <italic>t</italic> <sub>r</sub> in case of any malfunction of any part of the tritium processing system, and the doubling time ( <italic>t</italic> <sub>d</sub> ). Results show that <italic>η</italic> <sub>f</sub> <italic>f</italic> <sub>b</sub> &gt; 2% and processing time of 1–4 h are required to achieve tritium self-sufficiency with reasonable confidence. For <italic>η</italic> <sub>f</sub> <italic>f</italic> <sub>b</sub> = 2% and processing time of 4 h, the tritium start-up inventory required for a 3 GW fusion reactor is ∼11 kg, while it is &lt;5 kg if <italic>η</italic> <sub>f</sub> <italic>f</italic> <sub>b</sub> = 5% and the processing time is 1 h. To achieve these stringent requirements, a serious R&amp;D program in physics and technology is necessary. The EU-DEMO direct internal recycling concept that carries fuel directly from the plasma exhaust gas to the fueling systems without going through the isotope separation system reduces the overall processing time and tritium inventories and has positive effects on the required tritium breeding ratio (TBR <sub>R</sub> ). A significant finding is the strong dependence of tritium self-sufficiency on the reactor availability factor. Simulations show that tritium self-sufficiency is: impossible if AF &lt; 10% for any <italic>η</italic> <sub>f</sub> <italic>f</italic> <sub>b</sub> , possible if AF &gt; 30% and 1% ⩽ <italic>η</italic> <sub>f</sub> <italic>f</italic> <sub>b</sub> ⩽ 2%, and achievable with reasonable confidence if AF &gt; 50% and <italic>η</italic> <sub>f</sub> <italic>f</italic> <sub>b</sub> &gt; 2%. These results are of particular concern in light of the low availability factor predicted for the near-term plasma-based experimental facilities (e.g. FNSF, VNS, CTF), and can have repercussions on tritium economy in DEMO reactors as well, unless significant advancements in RAMI are made. There is a linear dependency between the tritium start-up inventory and the fusion power. The required tritium start-up inventory for a fusion facility of 100 MW fusion power is as small as 1 kg. Since fusion power plants will have large powers for better economics, it is important to maintain a ‘reserve’ tritium inventory in the tritium storage system to continue to fuel the plasma and avoid plant shutdown in case of malfunctions of some parts of the tritium processing lines. But our results show that a reserve time as short as 24 h leads to unacceptable reserve and start-up inventory requirements. Therefore, high reliability and fast maintainability of all components in the fuel cycle are necessary in order to avoid the need for storing reserve tritium inventory sufficient for continued fusion facility operation for more than a few hours. The physics aspects of plasma fueling, tritium burn fraction, and particle and power exhaust are highly interrelated and complex, and predictions for DEMO and power reactors are highly uncertain because of lack of experiments with burning plasma. Fueling by pellet injection on the high field side of tokamak has evolved to be the preferred method to fuel a burning plasma. Extrapolation from the DIII-D penetration scaling shows fueling efficiency expected in DEMO to be &lt;25%, but such extrapolations are highly uncertain. The fueling efficiency of gas in a reactor relevant regime is expected to be extremely poor and not very useful for getting tritium into the core plasma efficiently. Gas fueling will nonetheless be useful for feedback control of the divertor operating parameters. Extensive modeling has been carried out to predict burn fraction, fueling requirements, and fueling efficiency for ITER, DEMO, and beyond. The fueling rate required to operate <italic>Q</italic> = 10 ITER plasmas in order to provide the required core fueling, helium exhaust and radiative divertor plasma conditions for acceptable divertor power loads was calculated. If this fueling is performed with a 50–50 DT mix, the tritium burn fraction in ITER would be ∼0.36%, which is too low to satisfy the self-sufficiency conditions derived from the dynamics modeling for fusion reactors. Extrapolation to DEMO using this approach would also yield similarly low burn fraction. Extensive analysis presented shows that specific features of edge neutral dynamics in ITER and fusion reactors, which are different from present experiments, open possibilities for optimization of tritium fueling and thus to improve the burn fraction. Using only tritium in pellet fueling of the plasma core, and only deuterium for edge density, divertor power load and ELM control results in significant increase of the burn fraction to 1.8–3.6%. These estimates are performed with physics models whose results cannot be fully validated for ITER and DEMO plasma conditions since these cannot be achieved in present tokamak experiments. Thus, several uncertainties remain regarding particle transport and scenario requirements in ITER and DEMO. The safety standard requirements for protection of the public and release guidelines for tritium have been reviewed. General safety approaches including minimizing tritium inventories, reducing tritium permeation through materials, and decontaminating material for waste disposal have been suggested. </p>},

This has been defined to take into account the input from the DEMO pre-conceptual design activities, the findings and recommendations of a thorough technical and programmatic assessment of the breeding blanket and the EU ITER Test Blanket Module (TBM) programs, conducted in 2017 by an independent expert panel. This work has led to the identification of (i) the most mature and technically sound breeding blanket concepts to be used as “driver” and “advanced” breeding blankets in DEMO, the latter to be installed and tested in a limited number of properly designed segments, potentially being more attractive for future fusion power plants; (ii) the remaining technical gaps and R&D priorities. A number of urgent steps that are required to better align and strengthen the EU TBM and DEMO Breeding Blanket Program as a whole and to aim at an efficient implementation of the work are described in this paper. These include a proposal to change the EU TBM options to be tested in ITER in order to obtain important and useful information from the two current breeders (solid and liquid) and coolants (helium and water) considered for DEMO.},

@article{You2022,
   abstract = {In a power plant scale fusion reactor, a huge amount of thermal power produced by the fusion reaction and external heating must be exhausted through the narrow area of the divertor targets. The targets must withstand the intense bombardment of the diverted particles where high heat fluxes are generated and erosion takes place on the surface. A considerable amount of volumetric nuclear heating power must also be exhausted. To cope with such an unprecedented power exhaust challenge, a highly efficient cooling capacity is required. Furthermore, the divertor must fulfill other critical functions such as nuclear shielding and channeling (and compression) of exhaust gas for pumping. Assuring the structural integrity of the neutron-irradiated (thus embrittled) components is a crucial prerequisite for a reliable operation over the lifetime. Safety, maintainability, availability, waste and costs are another points of consideration. In late 2020, the Pre-Conceptual Design activities to develop the divertor of the European demonstration fusion reactor were officially concluded. On this occasion, the baseline design and the key technology options were identified and verified by the project team (EUROfusion Work Package Divertor) based on seven years of R&D efforts and endorsed by Gate Review Panel. In this paper, an overview of the load specifications, brief descriptions of the design and the highlights of the technology R&D work are presented together with the further work still needed.},

   abstract = {<p> In this paper, the Chinese Fusion Engineering Testing Reactor (CFETR) power conversion system, with a supercritical CO <sub>2</sub> (SCO <sub>2</sub> ) Brayton cycle, is designed, analyzed and optimized. Considering the pulse operation of the reactor, a heat storage loop with high temperature molten salt and low temperature concrete is introduced. Based on the parameters of the first cooling loop, the CFETR power conversion loop is designed and studied. A new SCO <sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle for the CFETR dual heat sources, blanket and divertor, is developed and optimized using a genetic algorithm. Compared to other simple and recompression cycles, it is shown that the new SCO <sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle combines maximum thermal efficiency with simplicity. Exergy analyses are carried out and show that the exergy destruction rates of turbine and heat exchangers between different loops are the largest due to the large turbine power and the large temperature difference. The exergoeconomic analyses show that the fusion reactor accounts for the main cost, which is the key to the economy of fusion power generation. The following sensitivity analyses show that the hot molten salt temperature has a major influence on the system performance. Finally, several multi-criteria optimization algorithms are introduced to simultaneously optimize the three fitness functions, the cycle thermal efficiency, the system exergy efficiency and the total system product unit cost. It is found that the maximum thermal efficiency, the maximum exergy efficiency and the lowest total system product unit cost can be obtained almost simultaneously for the new CFETR power conversion system, and this optimal operation scheme is presented. </p>},

   abstract = {DEMO will be a fusion power plant demonstrating the integration into the grid architecture of an electric utility grid. The design of the power conversion chain is of particular importance, as it must adequately account for the specifics of nuclear fusion on the generation side and ensure compatibility with the electric utility grid at all times. One of the special challenges the foreseen pulsed operation, which affects the operation of the entire heat transport chain. This requires a time-dependant analysis of different concept design approaches to ensure proof of reliable operation and efficiency to obtain nuclear licensing. Several architectures of Balance of Plant were conceived and developed during the DEMO Pre-Concept Design Phase in order to suit needs and constraints of the in-vessel systems, with particular regard to the different blanket concepts. At this early design stage, emphasis was given to the achievement of robust solutions for all essential Balance of Plant systems, which have chiefly to ensure feasible and flexible operation modes during the main DEMO operating phases – Pulse, Dwell and ramp-up/down – and to adsorb and compensate for potential fusion power fluctuations during plasma flat-top. Although some criticalities, requiring further design improvements were identified, these preliminary assessments showed that the investigated cooling system architectures have the capability to restore nominal conditions after any of the abovementioned cases and that the overall availability could meet the DEMO top-level requirements. This paper describes the results of the studies on the tokamak coolant and Power Conversion System (PCS) options and critically highlights the aspects that require further work.},

   abstract = {<p>The use of data-based models is a favorable way to optimize existing industrial processes. Estimation of these models requires data with sufficient information content. However, data from regular process operation are typically limited to single operating points, so industrially applicable design of experiments (DoE) methods are needed. This paper presents a stepwise DoE and modeling methodology, using Gaussian process regression that incorporates expert knowledge. This expert knowledge regarding an appropriate operating point and the importance of various process inputs is exploited in both the model construction and the experimental design. An incremental modeling scheme is used in which a model is additively extended by another submodel in a stepwise fashion, each estimated on a suitable experimental design. Starting with the most important process input for the first submodel, the number of considered inputs is incremented in each step. The strengths and weaknesses of the methodology are investigated, using synthetic data in different scenarios. The results show that a high overall model quality is reached, especially for processes with few interactions between the inputs and low noise levels. Furthermore, advantages in the interpretability and applicability for industrial processes are discussed and demonstrated, using a real industrial use case as an example.</p>},

   abstract = {The Lawson criterion is a key concept in the pursuit of fusion energy, relating the fuel density n, pulse duration τ or energy confinement time τE, and fuel temperature T to the energy gain Q of a fusion plasma. The purpose of this paper is to explain and review the Lawson criterion and to provide a compilation of achieved parameters for a broad range of historical and contemporary fusion experiments. Although this paper focuses on the Lawson criterion, it is only one of many equally important factors in assessing the progress and ultimate likelihood of any fusion concept becoming a commercially viable fusion-energy system. Only experimentally measured or inferred values of n, τ or τE, and T that have been published in the peer-reviewed literature are included in this paper, unless noted otherwise. For extracting these parameters, we discuss methodologies that are necessarily specific to different fusion approaches (including magnetic, inertial, and magneto-inertial fusion). This paper is intended to serve as a reference for fusion researchers and a tutorial for all others interested in fusion energy.},
